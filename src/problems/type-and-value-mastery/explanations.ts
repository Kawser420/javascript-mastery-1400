    'tvm-typeof-string': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a fundamental problem to understand JavaScript's primitive types. The \`typeof\` operator is a built-in tool that returns a string indicating the type of an unevaluated operand.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The operator is placed before the value you want to check.
\`\`\`javascript
typeof "hello world"; // This expression evaluates to the string "string"
\`\`\`
The value \`"hello world"\` is a string literal, and its type is correctly identified as \`"string"\`.

### üìö Key Concepts

    'tvm-typeof-null-bug': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a famous, long-standing bug in JavaScript. When the \`typeof\` operator is used on the value \`null\`, it incorrectly returns the string \`"object"\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The operator is applied to \`null\`.
\`\`\`javascript
typeof null; // "object"
\`\`\`
This is a mistake from the very first version of JavaScript that has been kept for backward compatibility. The correct way to check for \`null\` is with strict equality: \`value === null\`.

This problem demonstrates the main feature of strict equality: it does not perform type coercion. If the types are different, the result is always \`false\`, even if the values look the same.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 === "5"; // false
\`\`\`
Because the types (\`number\` and \`string\`) are different, the comparison immediately returns \`false\`.

    'tvm-loose-equality-coercion': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The loose equality operator (\`==\`) compares two values for equality *after* attempting to convert them to a common type. This is called type coercion. Its behavior can sometimes be unpredictable, so \`===\` is generally preferred.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 == "5"; // true
\`\`\`
Before comparing, JavaScript coerces the string \`"5"\` into the number \`5\`. Since \`5\` is equal to \`5\`, the result is \`true\`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem explores a special case in JavaScript's equality rules. \`null\` and \`undefined\` are the only two values that are loosely equal to each other but not to anything else. They are not strictly equal because they are of different types.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The two values are compared with both operators.
\`\`\`javascript

The strict inequality operator (\`!==\`) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It returns \`true\` if the operands are not equal or are not of the same type. It does not perform type coercion.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 !== "5"; // true
\`\`\`
Because their types are different, they are not strictly equal, so the strict inequality operator returns \`true\`.

    // problem explanation--> 17
    'tvm-loose-inequality': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The loose inequality operator (\`!=\`) is the logical opposite of the loose equality operator (\`==\`). It compares two values for inequality after attempting type coercion.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 != "5"; // false
\`\`\`
Before comparing, JavaScript coerces the string \`"5"\` into the number \`5\`. Since \`5\` is equal to \`5\`, the inequality check returns \`false\`.

\`NaN\` (Not a Number) is a unique numeric value in JavaScript. It is the only value that is not equal to anything, including itself, using either loose (==) or strict (===) equality.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`NaN\` is compared to itself.
\`\`\`javascript
NaN === NaN; // false

    'tvm-number-tostring-radix': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The `.toString()` method on a number can take an optional radix (base) argument, which allows you to convert the number to a string representation in a different base.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A decimal number is converted to its hexadecimal (base 16) string.
\`\`\`javascript
(255).toString(16); // "ff"
(10).toString(2);  // "1010"
\`\`\`
This is the inverse operation of `parseInt()` with a radix.

    'tvm-object-comparison': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a fundamental concept: objects are compared by **reference**, not by value. This means that two different object variables are only considered equal if they point to the exact same object in memory.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two separate but identical-looking objects are compared.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj1 = { a: 1 };
const obj2 = { a: 1 };
const obj3 = obj1;

obj1 === obj2; // false, because they are two different objects in memory.
obj1 === obj3; // true, because they both point to the same object.
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Reference vs. Value**: Primitives are compared by value; objects are compared by reference.

    // problem explanation--> 45
    'tvm-array-comparison': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Like objects, arrays are reference types. They are compared by reference, not by their content. Two separate arrays are never equal, even if they contain the exact same elements.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two separate but identical-looking arrays are compared.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr1 = [];
const arr2 = [];

arr1 === arr2; // false
\`\`\`
To compare the contents of two arrays, you must iterate through them and compare each element individually.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Reference Types**: Arrays are a type of object and follow the same reference-based comparison rules.

    // problem explanation--> 46
    'tvm-object-reference-assignment': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When you assign an object variable to another variable, you are not creating a new object. You are only copying the **reference** (the memory address). Both variables now point to the same single object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A change made through one variable is visible through the other.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = { value: 10 };
const reference = original; // Both variables point to the same object

reference.value = 20;

// The change is reflected in the original variable
console.log(original.value); // 20

    // problem explanation--> 47
    'tvm-primitive-assignment': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When you assign a primitive variable (like a number or string) to another variable, the **value** itself is copied. The two variables are then completely independent.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A change made to one variable does not affect the other.
\`\`\`javascript
let prim1 = 10;
let prim2 = prim1; // prim2 gets a copy of the value 10

prim2 = 20;

// The original variable is unaffected
console.log(prim1); // 10

    // problem explanation--> 48
    'tvm-pass-primitive-to-function': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates "pass-by-value". When you pass a primitive type as an argument to a function, the function receives a **copy** of that value. Any modifications made to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original variable outside the function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A number is passed to a function that tries to modify it.
\`\`\`javascript
let myVar = 10;
function modify(val) {
  val = 20; // 'val' is a local copy
}
modify(myVar);
// 'myVar' is still 10.
\`\`\`

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Pass by Value**: The function receives a copy of the primitive's value.

    // problem explanation--> 49
    'tvm-pass-object-to-function': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When you pass an object (including an array) to a function, the "pass-by-sharing" mechanism is used. The function receives a **copy of the reference** to the object. Because both the original variable and the function's parameter point to the *same* object in memory, modifying the object's properties inside the function will affect the original object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An object's property is modified inside a function.
\`\`\`javascript
const myObj = { a: 1 };
function modify(obj) {
  // 'obj' points to the same object as 'myObj'
  obj.a = 2;
}
modify(myObj);
// myObj.a is now 2
\`\`\`

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Pass by Reference (Sharing)**: The function receives a reference to the same object, not a copy of the object itself.

    // problem explanation--> 50
    'tvm-reassign-object-param': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This clarifies a common point of confusion with "pass-by-reference." While you can *mutate* the object a parameter refers to, you cannot change the original external variable by *reassigning* the parameter inside the function. Reassigning the parameter just makes it point to a new object, breaking its link to the original one.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function's parameter is reassigned to a new object.
\`\`\`javascript
const myObj = { a: 1 };
function modify(obj) {
  // This makes the local 'obj' parameter point to a brand new object.
  // It does not affect the original 'myObj' variable.
  obj = { a: 99 };
}
modify(myObj);
// myObj is still { a: 1 }
\`\`\`

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Local Scope**: Function parameters are local variables. Reassigning them only affects the local scope.
