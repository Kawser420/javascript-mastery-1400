### üí° Problem Breakdown
A generator function is a special type of function that can be paused and resumed, allowing it to produce a sequence of values over time instead of computing them all at once. It's defined with \`function*\` and uses the \`yield\` keyword to "produce" a value and pause its execution.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution defines a generator that yields three numbers one by one.
\`\`\`javascript
function* numberGenerator() {
    console.log("Yielding 1");
    yield 1;
    console.log("Yielding 2");
    yield 2;
    console.log("Yielding 3");
    yield 3;
}

const gen = numberGenerator(); // Calling it doesn't run the code yet
gen.next(); // Runs until the first yield
gen.next(); // Resumes and runs until the second yield
\`\`\`
1.  **\`function*\`**: The asterisk (\`*\`) marks this as a generator function.
2.  **\`yield\`**: This keyword pauses the generator's execution and returns the value of the expression following it.
3.  **Iterator**: Calling the generator returns an iterator object. You must call \`.next()\` on this iterator to execute the code.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Generator Function**: A function that can be exited and later re-entered, with its context (variable bindings) saved across re-entrances.
-   **Iterator**: The object returned by a generator, which is used to control its execution via the \`.next()\` method.
`,
  "generator-iterator-protocol": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Calling a generator function returns an iterator. This iterator follows the JavaScript iterator protocol. The task is to understand the object returned by the iterator's \`.next()\` method.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`.next()\` method returns an object with two properties: \`value\` and \`done\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function* generator() {
    yield 'a';
    yield 'b';
}
const iterator = generator();

iterator.next(); // { value: 'a', done: false }
iterator.next(); // { value: 'b', done: false }
iterator.next(); // { value: undefined, done: true }
\`\`\`
1.  **\`value\`**: This property contains the yielded value from the generator function.
2.  **\`done\`**: This is a boolean. It is \`false\` as long as the generator can produce more values. It becomes \`true\` when the generator has completed its execution (i.e., after the final \`yield\` or a \`return\` statement).

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Iterator Protocol**: The standard way iterators work in JavaScript, defined by the structure of the object returned by the \`.next()\` method.
`,
  "generator-yield-delegation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`yield*\` expression is used to delegate the iteration from one generator to another iterable object (like another generator, an array, or a string). It's a convenient way to compose generators together or yield all the values from an iterable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`gen2\` uses \`yield*\` to first yield all values from \`gen1\` and then an array before yielding its own final value.
\`\`\`javascript
function* gen1() { yield 1; yield 2; }
function* gen2() {
  yield* gen1(); // Delegates to gen1
  yield* ['x', 'y']; // Delegates to the array
  yield 3;
}
const result = [...gen2()]; // [1, 2, 'x', 'y', 3]
\`\`\`
1.  **\`yield* iterable\`**: This syntax iterates over the provided iterable and yields each of its values. The \`yield*\` expression itself evaluates to the \`value\` property of the final object returned by the delegated iterator when it's \`done\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **\`yield*\`**: An expression for delegating to another iterable, useful for generator composition.
`,
  "generator-passing-values": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Generators can be used for two-way communication. They can \`yield\` values to the outside, but the outside caller can also pass values *back into* the generator via the \`.next(value)\` method. The value passed to \`.next()\` becomes the result of the \`yield\` expression that paused the generator.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A generator yields a question, and the answer is passed back in the next call to \`.next()\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function* twoWayGenerator() {
  const name = yield "What's your name?";
  const confirmation = yield \`Hello, \${name}! Is that correct?\`;
  return \`Confirmation: \${confirmation}\`;
}

const it = twoWayGenerator();
it.next();      // Starts the generator, yields "What's your name?"
it.next('Alice'); // Resumes, 'name' becomes "Alice", yields "Hello, Alice!..."
it.next('Yes');   // Resumes, 'confirmation' becomes "Yes", returns the final value.
\`\`\`
1.  **First \`.next()\`**: The first call to \`.next()\` never passes a value, it only starts the generator.
2.  **Subsequent \`.next(value)\`**: The value passed in becomes the result of the previously executed \`yield\` statement.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Co-routines**: This two-way communication allows generators to be used as co-routines, where two or more functions can pass control back and forth.
`,
  "generator-return": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A generator function can have a \`return\` statement. When the generator executes this \`return\`, it finishes and produces one final object from its iterator where \`done\` is \`true\` and \`value\` is the value that was returned. Any subsequent calls to \`.next()\` will also return \`{ value: undefined, done: true }\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A generator yields once and then returns a final value.
\`\`\`javascript
function* gen() {
    yield 1;
    return "Finished";
}
const it = gen();
it.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
it.next(); // { value: "Finished", done: true }

`,
  "proxy-get-trap": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An ES6 \`Proxy\` is an object that wraps another object (the "target") and allows you to intercept fundamental operations, called "traps". The \`get\` trap is called whenever a property is read from the proxy. This allows you to define custom behavior for property access.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy is created with a \`get\` trap that returns a default value for any property that doesn't exist on the target object.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { a: 1 };
const handler = {
  get: function(obj, prop) {
    return prop in obj ? obj[prop] : 'Default Value';
  }
};
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

proxy.a; // 1
proxy.b; // "Default Value"
\`\`\`
1.  **\`handler.get(obj, prop)\`**: The \`get\` trap receives the target object (\`obj\`) and the property name (\`prop\`) being accessed.
2.  **Logic**: The trap's logic checks if the property exists on the object and returns the appropriate value.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Proxy**: An object that wraps another object and intercepts operations.
-   **Trap**: A method on the handler that provides access to an operation (e.g., the \`get\` trap).
-   **Metaprogramming**: Code that can read or manipulate other code. Proxies are a form of metaprogramming.
`,
  "proxy-set-trap": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`set\` trap on a Proxy is called whenever there is an attempt to set a property on the proxy object. This is extremely useful for implementing validation, logging, or triggering side effects on property changes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy's \`set\` trap is used to ensure that only numeric values can be assigned to the \`age\` property.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { age: 0 };
const handler = {
  set: function(obj, prop, value) {
    if (prop === 'age' && typeof value !== 'number') {
      throw new TypeError("Age must be a number.");
    }
    // Perform the actual assignment
    obj[prop] = value;
    return true; // Indicate that the assignment succeeded
  }
};
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
proxy.age = 30;         // Success
// proxy.age = "thirty"; // Throws TypeError
\`\`\`
1.  **\`handler.set(obj, prop, value)\`**: The \`set\` trap receives the target, the property name, and the new value.
2.  **Return Value**: The \`set\` trap must return a boolean. Returning \`true\` indicates the assignment was successful. Returning \`false\` in non-strict mode will fail silently.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Validation**: Using a \`set\` trap is a powerful way to enforce data integrity.
`,
  "proxy-apply-trap": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`apply\` trap is used when a proxy wraps a function. This trap intercepts calls to the function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy is created around a target function. The \`apply\` trap logs the arguments and modifies the return value.
\`\`\`javascript
const targetFunc = (a, b) => a + b;
const handler = {
  apply: function(target, thisArg, argumentsList) {
    console.log(\`Calling function with args: \${argumentsList}\`);

    const result = target(...argumentsList);
    return result * 2;
  }
};
const proxy = new Proxy(targetFunc, handler);
proxy(2, 3); // Logs "Calling..." and returns 10
\`\`\`
1.  **\`handler.apply(target, thisArg, argumentsList)\`**: The trap receives the target function, the \`this\` context the function was called with, and a list of its arguments.

### üìö Key Concepts
-   **Function Interception**: Using a proxy to add behavior before or after a function call.
`,
  "proxy-construct-trap": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`construct\` trap intercepts the \`new\` operator. When you use \`new\` on a proxy that wraps a class or constructor function, the \`construct\` trap is triggered.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy is created around a class. The \`construct\` trap logs the instantiation and modifies the arguments passed to the constructor.
\`\`\`javascript
class TargetClass {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name; }
}
const handler = {
  construct: function(target, args) {
    console.log(\`Constructing an instance of \${target.name}\`);

    return new target(\`Proxied \${args[0]}\`);
  }
};
const ProxiedClass = new Proxy(TargetClass, handler);
const instance = new ProxiedClass('Test');
// instance.name is "Proxied Test"
\`\`\`
1.  **\`handler.construct(target, args)\`**: The trap receives the target class/function and an array of the arguments passed to the constructor.
2.  **Return Value**: The trap must return an object.

  "proxy-revocable": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Proxy.revocable()\` is a static method that creates a special kind of proxy that can be "turned off." It returns an object containing the proxy itself and a \`revoke\` function. Once the \`revoke\` function is called, the proxy becomes unusable, and any attempt to access its properties will throw a \`TypeError\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A revocable proxy is created and then revoked.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { a: 1 };
const { proxy, revoke } = Proxy.revocable(target, {});

console.log(proxy.a); // 1

// Turn off the proxy
revoke();

// console.log(proxy.a); // Throws TypeError: Cannot perform 'get' on a proxy that has been revoked
\`\`\`
This is useful for managing access control, where you might want to grant temporary access to an object and then revoke it later.

  "reflect-api-get-set": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`Reflect\` object is a built-in object that provides static methods for interceptable JavaScript operations. The methods on \`Reflect\` have a one-to-one mapping with the traps for Proxies. It's considered best practice to use \`Reflect\` methods inside proxy traps to perform the default underlying operation on the target object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`Reflect.get\` and \`Reflect.set\` are used to perform the default operations.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { a: 1 };

This is a conceptual problem. A \`SharedArrayBuffer\` is a fixed-length raw binary data buffer, similar to \`ArrayBuffer\`, but with a key difference: it can be shared across multiple JavaScript execution contexts (e.g., between the main browser thread and a Web Worker). When a change is made to the buffer in one context, that change is immediately visible in the other, eliminating the need for costly data copying with \`postMessage\`.

ES2022 introduced the ability to use the \`in\` operator to check for the existence of a private field on an object from within the class. This is necessary because you cannot access or check for private fields from outside a class, and a normal check would throw a syntax error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A static method is used to check if an instance has a private field.
\`\`\`javascript
class MyClass {
    #privateField = 1;
    static hasPrivate(obj) {
        return #privateField in obj;
    }
}
const instance = new MyClass();
MyClass.hasPrivate(instance); // true
\`\`\`

  "hashbang-grammar-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a feature for creating command-line scripts with JavaScript. The "hashbang" or "shebang" is the first line of a script, \`#!\`, which tells a Unix-like operating system which interpreter to use to run the file.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
ES2023 standardized that JavaScript engines should ignore this first line.
\`\`\`javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// This is now a valid Node.js script
console.log('Hello from a script!');
\`\`\`
1.  Make the file executable: \`chmod +x my-script.js\`
2.  Run it directly from the shell: \`./my-script.js\`

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Scripting**: Using JavaScript to create command-line tools.

  "promise-withresolvables-conceptual-adv": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Promise.withResolvables()\` is a new static method (ES2024) that creates a promise and exposes its \`resolve\` and \`reject\` functions. This is a convenience method that simplifies patterns where you need to create a promise and resolve/reject it from outside the constructor's scope.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The method is used to create a "deferred" promise.
\`\`\`javascript
const { promise, resolve, reject } = Promise.withResolvables();

// We can now use the promise
promise.then(console.log);

// And resolve it from somewhere else, later
setTimeout(() => resolve("Resolved from outside!"), 100);
\`\`\`
This avoids having to define \`let resolveFunc;\` outside the scope of a \`new Promise\` constructor.

### üìö Key Concepts
- \`Promise.withResolvables()\`: A new utility for creating promises where the settlement functions are needed externally.
`,
  "well-known-symbol-unscopables": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a rarely used feature for backward compatibility. The \`Symbol.unscopables\` well-known symbol can be used to specify properties on an object's prototype that should *not* be added to the lexical scope when using the deprecated \`with\` statement.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`values\` property is excluded from the \`with\` statement's scope.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {
  keys: ['a'],
  values: [1]
};
obj[Symbol.unscopables] = {
  values: true // Exclude 'values'
};

with (obj) {
  console.log(keys);   // ['a']
  // console.log(values); // ReferenceError: values is not defined
}

### üìö Key Concepts
- \`with\` statement: A deprecated language feature that is forbidden in strict mode.
`,
  "proxy-for-dom-nodes": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. A Proxy can be wrapped around a DOM element to intercept interactions with it. This can be useful for debugging, logging, or creating a custom API layer over a DOM element.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy's \`get\` trap could log all property accesses on a button element.
\`\`\`javascript
const myButton = document.getElementById('myBtn');
const buttonProxy = new Proxy(myButton, {
  get(target, prop) {
    console.log(\`Accessing property: \${String(prop)}\`);
    return Reflect.get(target, prop);
  }
});

// Now, any interaction like buttonProxy.id or buttonProxy.textContent
// will be logged to the console.
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Metaprogramming**: Using proxies to observe and control interactions with host objects like DOM elements.
`,
  "generator-for-async-control-flow": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Before \`async/await\` was introduced, libraries like \`co\` used generators to enable a similar synchronous-looking style for asynchronous code. This problem demonstrates the underlying pattern.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A "runner" function is created that takes a generator. It calls \`.next()\` on the generator's iterator. When it receives a yielded promise, it waits for it to resolve and then calls \`.next()\` again, passing the resolved value back into the generator.
\`\`\`javascript
function run(generator) {
  const iterator = generator();
  function advance(value) {
    const result = iterator.next(value);
    if (result.done) return result.value;
    result.value.then(val => advance(val));
  }
  advance();
}

// Usage
run(function*() {
  const result1 = yield Promise.resolve(1);
  const result2 = yield Promise.resolve(result1 + 1);
  console.log(result2); // 2
});
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- \`async/await\` Under the Hood: This pattern is essentially what \`async/await\` is syntactic sugar for.
`,
  "structured-clone": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`structuredClone()\` global function (available in modern browsers and Node.js) provides a standard way to create a deep copy of a JavaScript value. It is more robust than the \`JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))\` trick because it can handle more data types, such as \`Date\`, \`RegExp\`, \`Map\`, \`Set\`, and cyclical references.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An object containing a \`Date\` and a \`Map\` is deep-copied.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = {
  date: new Date(),
  map: new Map([['a', 1]])
};
const copy = structuredClone(original);

// The nested objects are also new, independent instances
console.log(original.map === copy.map); // false
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Deep Copy**: Creating a completely independent copy of a data structure.
- \`structuredClone()\`: The modern, built-in API for deep copying.
`,
  "intl-locale-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`Intl.Locale\` object provides a standard way to parse and manipulate Unicode locale identifier strings (e.g., "en-US-u-ca-gregory").

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A new \`Intl.Locale\` object is created and its properties are inspected.
\`\`\`javascript
const locale = new Intl.Locale('fr-CA', {
  hourCycle: 'h12',
  calendar: 'gregory'
});

console.log(locale.baseName);    // "fr-CA"
console.log(locale.language);    // "fr"
console.log(locale.region);      // "CA"
console.log(locale.hourCycle);   // "h12"
\`\`\`
This is useful for parsing user locale preferences and configuring other \`Intl\` formatters.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: \`Intl.Locale\` is a tool for working with locale identifiers.
`,
  "intl-calendars-timezones": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`Intl.DateTimeFormat\` constructor can take options to format dates according to different calendars and time zones.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A date is formatted for the Japanese calendar and Tokyo time zone.
\`\`\`javascript
const date = new Date();
const options = {
  timeZone: 'Asia/Tokyo',
  calendar: 'japanese',
  dateStyle: 'full'
};
const formatter = new Intl.DateTimeFormat('en-US', options);
// Example output: "Friday, May 3, 6 Heisei" (year depends on current date)

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Internationalization (i18n)**: Handling different calendar systems and time zones is a key part of i18n.
`,
  "reflect-getprototypeof": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Reflect.getPrototypeOf()\` is the functional equivalent of \`Object.getPrototypeOf()\`. It returns the prototype of a given object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The method is used to get the prototype of an instance.
\`\`\`javascript
class MyClass {}
const inst = new MyClass();

const proto = Reflect.getPrototypeOf(inst);
console.log(proto === MyClass.prototype); // true
\`\`\`
It's often used in metaprogramming contexts where a functional approach is preferred over the static \`Object\` method.

### üìö Key Concepts
- \`Reflect\` API: Provides a set of methods for JavaScript Operations.
`,
  "proxy-for-operator-overloading": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. JavaScript does not have traditional operator overloading (the ability to define what the \`+\` or \`*\` operators do for your custom objects). However, you can use Proxies to *simulate* this behavior by intercepting method calls that are named after the operation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
You could create a custom \`Vector\` class and wrap it in a Proxy that intercepts a method call like \`add\`.
\`\`\`javascript
// This is not real operator overloading, but a simulation pattern.
class Vector { /* ... */ }
const handler = {
  get(target, prop) {
    if (prop === 'add') {
      return (otherVector) => { /* logic to add vectors */ };
    }
    // ... other "operators" ...
  }
};
\`\`\`
This allows for a syntax like \`proxyVector1.add(proxyVector2)\`, which feels more natural than a standard method call for some domains.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Operator Overloading**: A feature present in some languages (like C++) but not in JavaScript.
- **Proxies**: Can be used to create custom APIs and simulate language features.
