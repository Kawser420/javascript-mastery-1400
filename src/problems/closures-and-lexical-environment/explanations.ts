  "closures-lexical-scope-basic": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the most fundamental concept of lexical scope. "Lexical" means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code at the time of writing, not at runtime. An inner function has access to the variables of its outer functions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An \`outerVar\` is declared in the global scope of the solver.
2.  An \`innerFunction\` is defined inside that scope.
3.  The \`innerFunction\` does not have its own \`outerVar\`, so JavaScript's scope chain mechanism looks one level up.
4.  It finds \`outerVar\` in the parent scope and can access its value.
\`\`\`javascript
const outerVar = "I am outside!";
function innerFunction() {
  return outerVar; // Accesses the parent's variable
}
return innerFunction(); // Returns "I am outside!"
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Lexical Scope**: The scope defined by the physical placement of code.
- **Scope Chain**: The mechanism by which JavaScript looks up variables, moving from the current scope outwards.

  "closures-simple-closure": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A closure is formed when a function is defined inside another function and the inner function is returned or passed outside. The closure consists of the inner function and a reference to the lexical environment (the scope) in which it was created. This allows the inner function to "remember" and access the variables of its outer function, even after the outer function has finished executing.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  \`outerFunction\` is called. It defines a local variable \`outerVar\`.
2.  It returns \`innerFunction\`. \`innerFunction\` is defined *within* the scope of \`outerFunction\`, so it has access to \`outerVar\`.
3.  \`outerFunction\` finishes executing. Normally, its variables would be garbage collected.
4.  However, since \`myClosure\` (which is \`innerFunction\`) still exists and needs \`outerVar\`, the scope is kept alive.
5.  When \`myClosure()\` is called later, it can still access the "remembered" \`outerVar\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function outerFunction() {
  const outerVar = 'I remember my scope!';
  // This inner function is a closure
  return function innerFunction() {
    return outerVar;
  };
}
const myClosure = outerFunction();
// Even though outerFunction has returned, myClosure can still access outerVar.
myClosure(); // 'I remember my scope!'

  "closures-function-factory": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem introduces the "function factory" pattern. A factory is a function that creates and returns something else‚Äîin this case, other functions. By taking an argument, the factory can create customized functions, and it uses a closure to "bake in" that customization.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`makeGreeter\` function takes a \`greeting\` argument (e.g., 'Hello').
2.  It defines and returns an anonymous inner function.
3.  This inner function is a closure; it closes over the \`greeting\` variable.
4.  When we call \`makeGreeter('Hello')\`, we get back a specialized greeter function that will always use 'Hello'.
\`\`\`javascript
function makeGreeter(greeting) {
  // The inner function closes over 'greeting'
  return function (name) {
    return \`\${greeting}, \${name}!\`;
  };
}

const greetHello = makeGreeter('Hello');
const greetHola = makeGreeter('Hola');

greetHello('Alice'); // "Hello, Alice!"

  "closures-private-counter": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic example of using a closure to create private state. We want a counter where the \`count\` variable cannot be accessed or modified from the outside, except through the function we provide.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  \`createCounter\` is an outer function that runs once.
2.  It defines a local variable \`count\`. This variable is completely private to the scope of \`createCounter\`.
3.  It returns an inner function. This inner function is a closure that has access to the \`count\` variable.
4.  Each time the returned function (\`counter\`) is called, it can access and modify the same \`count\` variable from its "backpack" (its lexical environment).
\`\`\`javascript
const createCounter = () => {
  let count = 0; // This is the private state
  return () => {
    count++;
    return count;

const counter = createCounter();
// You cannot access 'count' directly, e.g., counter.count is undefined.

  "closures-scope-chain": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The scope chain is the mechanism JavaScript uses to find the value of a variable. When a function needs to access a variable, it first looks in its own local scope. If it can't find it, it looks at its outer function's scope, then that function's outer scope, and so on, until it reaches the global scope. This chain of nested scopes is the "scope chain".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  \`inner\` needs \`level1\`, \`level2\`, and \`level3\`.
2.  It finds \`level3\` in its own scope.
3.  It doesn't find \`level2\`, so it looks at its outer scope, which is \`outer\`. It finds \`level2\` there.
4.  It doesn't find \`level1\` in its own or \`outer\`'s scope, so it looks at \`outer\`'s outer scope, which is the global scope. It finds \`level1\` there.
\`\`\`javascript
const level1 = 'Level 1'; // Global scope
function outer() {
  const level2 = 'Level 2'; // outer's scope
  function inner() {
    const level3 = 'Level 3'; // inner's scope

  "closures-var-vs-let-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights the most significant difference between \`var\` and \`let\`/\`const\`.
- **\`var\`**: is **function-scoped**. When declared anywhere inside a function, it's treated as if it were declared at the top of that function. It is not contained by blocks like \`if\` or \`for\`.
- **\`let\`/\`const\`**: are **block-scoped**. They only exist within the nearest set of curly braces \`{}\` they are declared in.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
if (true) {
  let x = 'block-scoped';
  var y = 'function-scoped';
}
// console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError because x only existed in the 'if' block.
console.log(y); // "function-scoped", because 'var' is not contained by the 'if' block.
\`\`\`
The solver demonstrates this by showing that accessing the \`let\` variable outside its block throws an error, while the \`var\` variable is still accessible.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Function Scope**: The scope created by a function.
- **Block Scope**: The scope created by a pair of curly braces \`{}\`.

  "closures-closure-in-loop-var": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a famous JavaScript interview question. When you use \`var\` in a loop to create callbacks (like with \`setTimeout\`), all the callbacks share a closure over the *same* single variable \`i\`. The loop finishes almost instantly, setting \`i\` to its final value (3). By the time the \`setTimeout\` callbacks actually run (after ~10ms), they all see the current value of \`i\`, which is 3.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // All three callbacks are created, but they all
  // have a closure over the SAME 'i'.
  setTimeout(() => {
    // When this runs, the loop is long finished and i is 3.
    console.log(i); 
  }, 10);
}
// This will log 3, 3, 3.

  // problem explanation--> 08
  "closures-closure-in-loop-let": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows the modern, simple solution to the classic loop problem. When you use \`let\` in a \`for\` loop, JavaScript creates a **new binding** (a new version of the variable) for **each iteration** of the loop.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Because each iteration gets its own private copy of \`i\`, each \`setTimeout\` callback closes over a different variable with the correct value for that specific iteration.

\`\`\`javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // In this iteration, a NEW 'i' is created.
  // The callback closes over THIS specific 'i'.
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(i); 
  }, 10);
}
// This will correctly log 0, 1, 2.
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Block Scope**: The \`let\` variable is scoped to the loop's block.
- **Per-Iteration Binding**: The \`for\` loop has special behavior with \`let\` to create a new variable for each pass.
`,
  // problem explanation--> 09
  "closures-closure-in-loop-iife-fix": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Before ES6 introduced \`let\`, the standard way to solve the \`var\` loop problem was with an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). An IIFE is a function that is defined and executed right away. By wrapping the callback creation in an IIFE, we create a new function scope for each iteration of the loop.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The IIFE \`(function(j) { ... })(i)\` is created and called immediately on each loop iteration.
2.  The current value of \`i\` is passed as an argument to the IIFE.
3.  Inside the IIFE, this value is received as the parameter \`j\`.
4.  The \`setTimeout\` callback now forms a closure over the new scope created by the IIFE, capturing the value of \`j\`, which is unique for each iteration.
\`\`\`javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  // Create a new scope with an IIFE
  (function (j) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(j); // j is the captured value of i for this iteration
    }, 10);

  "closures-stateful-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another example of using a closure to maintain state between function calls. We need a function that behaves differently each time it's called, based on its internal history.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createToggle\` factory is used to create the private state.
2.  The \`isOn\` boolean variable is the private state, initialized to \`false\`. It's "closed over" by the returned function.
3.  Each time the returned function (\`toggle\`) is called, it flips the value of \`isOn\` and returns a string based on the new state. Because \`isOn\` is in the closure, it persists between calls.
\`\`\`javascript
const createToggle = () => {

  "closures-module-pattern": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Module Pattern is one of the most common and powerful uses of closures. It allows you to create objects with public methods that can access and manipulate private variables. This is achieved using an IIFE that returns an object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An IIFE is created. This runs once and creates a private scope.
2.  Inside the IIFE, a \`privateValue\` is declared. It is inaccessible from the outside.
3.  The IIFE returns an object literal. This object is the "public API" of our module.
4.  The methods on the returned object (\`add\`, \`getValue\`) were defined inside the IIFE, so they are closures that have access to the \`privateValue\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const calculator = (function () {
  let privateValue = 0; // Private state

  "closures-function-once": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a higher-order function (a function that takes or returns another function). We need to create a wrapper function that uses a closure to "remember" whether the original function has already been executed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`once\` function takes the original function \`fn\` as an argument.
2.  It declares two variables in its scope: \`hasBeenCalled\` and \`result\`. These will be closed over by the returned function.
3.  It returns a new function. This new function is the "wrapper".
4.  When the wrapper is called, it checks the \`hasBeenCalled\` flag.
5.  If it's the first call, it sets the flag to \`true\`, calls the original function \`fn\`, and stores the result in the closed-over \`result\` variable.
6.  On all subsequent calls, it skips the execution of \`fn\` and simply returns the stored \`result\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const once = (fn) => {
  let hasBeenCalled = false;
  let result;

  "closures-memoization": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Memoization is an optimization technique where you cache the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This is a perfect use case for closures, which can hold the private cache object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`memoize\` higher-order function takes a function \`fn\` to be memoized.
2.  It creates a private \`cache\` object within its scope.
3.  It returns a new function. This function is a closure that has access to the \`cache\`.
4.  When the new function is called, it creates a \`key\` from its arguments (using \`JSON.stringify\` is a simple way to do this for primitive arguments).
5.  It checks if the \`key\` exists in the \`cache\`. If yes, it returns the cached value.
6.  If not, it calls the original function \`fn\`, stores the result in the \`cache\`, and then returns the result.
\`\`\`javascript
const memoize = (fn) => {
  const cache = {};

  "closures-multiple-counters": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem reinforces the concept that each call to a factory function creates a new, independent closure with its own private state.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  We have a \`createCounter\` factory function.
2.  We call it once to create \`counterA\`. This creates one lexical environment with its own \`count\` variable (starting at 0).
3.  We call it a second time to create \`counterB\`. This creates a *completely separate* lexical environment with its own independent \`count\` variable (also starting at 0).
4.  Calling \`counterA()\` only affects the first \`count\`. Calling \`counterB()\` only affects the second \`count\`. They are completely isolated.

  "closures-password-protection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a practical example of encapsulation. We want to protect some data (\`secret\`) and only expose it under a specific condition (providing the correct password). A closure is perfect for holding both the secret data and the correct password privately.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createSecret\` function acts as a factory. It takes the \`secret\` data and the correct \`pass\`word.
2.  These two arguments are stored in the lexical environment of the factory.
3.  The factory returns an inner function. This inner function is a closure that "remembers" the \`secret\` and the \`pass\`.
4.  When the returned function is called, it checks if the provided password matches the closed-over \`pass\`. Only if they match does it return the closed-over \`secret\`.

  "closures-lexical-scope-with-parameters": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem explicitly demonstrates that a closure captures not just local variables from its parent scope, but also the parent's parameters. The parameters of a function are part of its lexical environment, just like any variables declared inside it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`outer\` function is called with the argument \`'Hello World'\`.
2.  Inside \`outer\`, this argument is available as the parameter \`param\`.
3.  The \`inner\` function is defined within this scope. It forms a closure over the lexical environment of \`outer\`.
4.  This environment includes \`param\`, so the closure "remembers" that \`param\` is \`'Hello World'\`.
5.  When the \`closure\` is called later, it accesses the remembered value.

  "closures-dynamic-event-handlers": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem that addresses a very common real-world use case for closures. Imagine creating a list of items, where each item has a "delete" button. When you click a button, you need to know which item to delete.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
If you create these buttons in a loop, you need to make sure each button's click handler remembers the correct item or item ID.
\`\`\`javascript
// Conceptual code for creating a list
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  const item = items[i];
  const button = document.createElement('button');

  // It closes over the 'item' variable from this loop iteration.
  button.onclick = () => {
    console.log('Deleting item:', item); 
  };
  
  // Add button to the page
}
\`\`\`
Because \`let\` creates a new \`item\` variable for each iteration, each \`onclick\` handler closes over a different, correct \`item\`. This wouldn't work with \`var\` for the same reasons as the \`setTimeout\` loop problem. Closures are the fundamental mechanism that makes this pattern work.

  "closures-currying-simple": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Currying is a technique from functional programming of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. Closures are the mechanism that makes currying possible in JavaScript.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The outer function \`add(a)\` is called with the first argument, \`5\`.
2.  It returns a new inner function. This inner function is a closure that has captured \`a\` (with the value \`5\`).
3.  This new function is then immediately called with the second argument, \`10\`, which it receives as \`b\`.
4.  Inside the inner function, it has access to both its own argument \`b\` and the closed-over argument \`a\`, so it can perform the addition.

1.  We have a generic \`multiply\` function that takes two arguments.
2.  We create a new function, \`double\`. It is a closure.
3.  Inside \`double\`, we always call the original \`multiply\` function, but we "hard-code" the first argument \`a\` to be \`2\`. The second argument \`b\` is passed through from \`double\`'s own arguments.

  "closures-hoisting-and-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.
- **\`var\`**: Declarations are hoisted to the top of the *function scope* and initialized with \`undefined\`.
- **\`let\`/\`const\`**: Declarations are hoisted to the top of the *block scope*, but they are not initialized, leading to the "Temporal Dead Zone".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solver demonstrates hoisting for \`var\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function testHoisting() {
  // At this point, 'x' has been declared and hoisted,
  // but its value is 'undefined'.
  console.log(x); // undefined
  
  var x = 'I am hoisted!';
  
  console.log(x); // 'I am hoisted!'

  x = 'I am hoisted!'; // Initialization stays here
  console.log(x);

  "closures-block-scope-no-closure": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem to clarify what a closure is. A closure requires a *function* that is defined in one scope and then accessed from an outer scope. A simple block scope on its own does not create a lasting closure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Consider this code:
\`\`\`javascript
{
  let x = 10;
  console.log(x);
}
// console.log(x); // ReferenceError
\`\`\`
Here, a block scope is created, and \`x\` exists within it. However, no function is created that "escapes" this scope. Once the block finishes executing, its lexical environment is no longer needed by anything, so it (and the variable \`x\`) can be garbage collected. A closure is only formed when an inner function maintains a live reference to its outer environment.

- **Garbage Collection**: Scopes that are no longer referenced are cleaned up.

  // problem explanation--> 22
  "closures-garbage-collection-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This conceptual problem explains the relationship between closures and memory management. Normally, when a function finishes executing, its local variables are destroyed (garbage collected). However, if that function returned an inner function (a closure) that still needs access to one of those variables, that variable cannot be destroyed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a feature, not a bug. It's the very mechanism that allows closures to "remember" their environment.
\`\`\`javascript
function createBigObject() {
  const largeData = new Array(1000000).fill('*');
  
  return function useData() {
    // This closure keeps 'largeData' alive
    return largeData.length;
  };
}

// As long as 'myClosure' exists, the 1-million-element array
// cannot be garbage collected, even though createBigObject has finished.
let myClosure = createBigObject(); 
\`\`\`
The JavaScript engine is smart enough to only keep the variables that the closure actually uses. If \`useData\` didn't use \`largeData\`, it would be collected.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Garbage Collection**: The automatic process of freeing up memory.
- **Reachability**: Memory is kept as long as it is "reachable" from a root reference. A closure keeps its environment reachable.

This problem demonstrates a crucial aspect of closures: they do not capture a *snapshot* of the variable's value at the time of creation. Instead, they capture a *live link* to the variable itself. If the variable's value changes, the closure will see the new value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An \`outerVar\` is declared.
2.  A closure, \`getOuter\`, is created which has access to \`outerVar\`.
3.  \`getOuter\` is called, and it returns the current value: 'Initial Value'.
4.  The \`outerVar\` is then changed to 'Changed Value'.
5.  \`getOuter\` is called again. It looks up \`outerVar\` through its scope chain and finds the new, updated value.
\`\`\`javascript
let outerVar = 'Initial Value';
function getOuter() {
  return outerVar;
}

getOuter(); // 'Initial Value'
outerVar = 'Changed Value';
getOuter(); // 'Changed Value'
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Live Link**: Closures maintain a reference to the variable, not just its value at a point in time.

  "closures-shared-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When a single outer function defines and returns multiple inner functions, all of those inner functions form closures over the *same* lexical environment. This means they can all see and interact with the same set of private variables.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createPerson\` factory creates a private \`accessCount\` variable.
2.  It returns an object with two methods: \`getName\` and \`getAccessCount\`.
3.  Both of these methods were defined inside \`createPerson\`, so they both share a closure over the same scope, which includes \`accessCount\`.
4.  When \`getName\` is called, it increments the shared \`accessCount\`.
5.  When \`getAccessCount\` is called, it increments and then returns the same, updated \`accessCount\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const createPerson = (name) => {
  let accessCount = 0; // Shared private state
  return {
    getName: () => {
      accessCount++;
      return name;
    },
    getAccessCount: () => {
      accessCount++;
      return accessCount;
    },

  "closures-async-callback": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that a closure's ability to "remember" its environment persists even across asynchronous operations. The callback function for \`setTimeout\` is a closure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`runLater\` function is called.
2.  It defines a local variable \`message\`.
3.  It calls \`setTimeout\`, passing an arrow function as the callback. This callback is a closure that captures the \`message\` variable.
4.  \`runLater\` finishes executing and its scope would normally be gone.
5.  After 50ms, the JavaScript event loop executes the callback.
6.  The callback can still access the \`message\` variable from its "remembered" lexical environment.
\`\`\`javascript
function runLater() {
  const message = 'The future is now!';
  setTimeout(() => {
    // This closure runs later, but still has access to 'message'
    console.log(message);

  "closures-shadowing": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (e.g., an inner function) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. When this happens, the inner variable takes precedence within its scope, temporarily "hiding" or "shadowing" the outer variable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An \`x\` is declared in the outer scope.
2.  An \`inner\` function is defined.
3.  Inside \`inner\`, another variable, also named \`x\`, is declared.
4.  When code inside \`inner\` refers to \`x\`, the scope chain lookup finds the inner \`x\` first and stops. It doesn't continue to the outer scope.
5.  Outside of \`inner\`, the outer \`x\` is unaffected.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 'outer';
function inner() {
  let x = 'inner'; // This 'x' shadows the outer 'x'
  return x;
}
console.log(x); // 'outer'
console.log(inner()); // 'inner'

  "closures-iife-privacy": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a common pattern for creating a private scope. Before ES6 modules, this was the primary way to avoid polluting the global scope and to create self-contained code blocks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  A function is defined: \`(function() { ... })\`.
2.  It is immediately invoked with the final pair of parentheses: \`()\`
3.  This creates a new function scope. Any variables declared with \`var\` (or \`let\`/\`const\`) inside the IIFE are local to that scope.
4.  They cannot be accessed from the outside (global) scope, preventing naming conflicts.
\`\`\`javascript
(function () {
  var privateVar = "I'm private";
  // All code for a module or library would go in here.
})();

// console.log(privateVar); // Throws a ReferenceError

  "closures-item-manager": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem is a practical application of the Module Pattern. We need to create a manager that handles a list of items. The core requirement is that the list itself (the array of items) must be private and can only be modified through the provided methods.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This follows the same logic as the calculator module:
1.  A factory function \`createManager\` creates the private scope.
2.  A private array \`items\` is declared inside.
3.  An object is returned containing the public methods: \`addItem\`, \`removeItem\`, and \`listItems\`.
4.  Each of these methods is a closure that can access and modify the shared, private \`items\` array.
5.  Crucially, \`listItems\` returns a *copy* of the array (\`items.slice()\`). This prevents the caller from getting a direct reference to the private array and mutating it from the outside.
\`\`\`javascript
const createManager = () => {
  let items = []; // Private state
  return {
    addItem: (item) => items.push(item),
    removeItem: (item) => { items = items.filter(i => i !== item); },
    listItems: () => items.slice(), // Return a copy for protection

  "closures-logger-factory": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another example of the Function Factory pattern. We want to create specialized logging functions. A factory can take a configuration option (the \`prefix\`) and return a new function that has this configuration "baked in" via a closure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createLogger\` factory takes a \`prefix\` string.
2.  It returns a new function that takes a \`message\` string.
3.  This returned function is a closure. It has access to the \`prefix\` from its parent's lexical environment.
4.  It combines the remembered \`prefix\` with the new \`message\` to create the final log string.
\`\`\`javascript
const createLogger = (prefix) => {

  "closures-this-and-lexical-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a very important conceptual distinction.
- **Lexical Scope**: Is static. It is determined by where you write your functions. To find a variable, JavaScript follows the chain of nested scopes outwards from where the function is defined.
- **\`this\` Keyword**: Is dynamic. It is determined by *how* a function is called at runtime (the "call-site"). It can be different each time the same function is called. The four main rules are:
    1.  Called as a method (\`obj.method()\`)? \`this\` is \`obj\`.
    2.  Called as a standalone function (\`myFunc()\`)? \`this\` is the global object (or \`undefined\` in strict mode).
    3.  Called with \`new\`? \`this\` is the new object being created.
    4.  Called with \`.call()\` or \`.apply()\`? \`this\` is explicitly set.

Arrow functions are the exception: their \`this\` is determined lexically, just like other variables.

  "closures-arrow-function-lexical-this": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the practical solution that arrow functions provide for the common "losing \`this\`" problem. A regular function gets its own \`this\` value at runtime, which is often not what you want in a callback. An arrow function does not have its own \`this\`; it inherits it from its parent's scope, just like any other variable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`greet\` method is called on the \`person\` object, so its \`this\` is the \`person\` object.
2.  Inside \`greet\`, an arrow function \`getMessage\` is defined.
3.  Because it's an arrow function, it does not get its own \`this\`. It looks for \`this\` in its surrounding scope, which is the \`greet\` method.
4.  It therefore uses the \`greet\` method's \`this\`, which is correctly pointing to the \`person\` object.
\`\`\`javascript
const person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function () {
    // 'this' here is the 'person' object.
    const getMessage = () => {
      // This arrow function captures the 'this' from its parent, 'greet'.

  "closures-retaining-state-in-map": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`Array.prototype.map\` method calls a provided function once for each element in an array. If that function is a stateful closure, it can produce results that depend not just on the current element, but also on what happened in previous calls.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createSteppedMapper\` factory creates and returns a stateful function (\`stepper\`).
2.  \`stepper\` is a closure that has access to a private \`step\` variable.
3.  When we pass \`stepper\` to the \`.map()\` method, the *same* function is called for each element of the array.
4.  On the first call, \`step\` becomes 1 and it returns 1.
5.  On the second call, the same \`step\` variable is incremented to 2 and it returns 2.
6.  And so on. The closure maintains the \`step\` state across all the calls made by \`.map()\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const createSteppedMapper = () => {
  let step = 0; // State is kept here
  return (currentArrayElement) => {
    // currentArrayElement is ignored in this specific problem
    step++;

  "closures-api-key-hiding": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a security and design pattern. You should never expose sensitive information like API keys directly. The Module Pattern, powered by closures, is the perfect way to encapsulate this information.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createApiClient\` factory takes the sensitive \`apiKey\`.
2.  The \`apiKey\` becomes part of the private lexical environment for the factory.
3.  The factory returns an object with public methods, like \`fetchData\`.
4.  \`fetchData\` is a closure that can access the private \`apiKey\` from its environment.
5.  Someone using the returned \`client\` object can call \`client.fetchData()\` but has no way to directly access or read the \`apiKey\` itself.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another practical higher-order function. We want to wrap a function to restrict how many times it can be executed. A closure is needed to privately track the number of calls.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`limitCalls\` HOF takes the original function \`fn\` and the \`limit\`.
2.  It creates a private \`callCount\` variable within its scope.
3.  It returns a new function. This new function is a closure over \`callCount\`.
4.  Each time the new function is called, it checks if \`callCount\` is less than the \`limit\`.
5.  If it is, it increments the counter and calls the original function.
6.  If not, it simply returns, effectively ignoring the call.

  "closures-function-composition": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Function composition is a fundamental concept in functional programming. It's the process of creating a new function by combining two or more existing functions, where the output of one becomes the input of the next.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`compose\` function takes two functions, \`f\` and \`g\`, as arguments.
2.  It returns a new function that takes a single argument \`x\`.
3.  This new function is a closure that "remembers" the functions \`f\` and \`g\`.
4.  When called, it first executes \`g(x)\`.
5.  It then takes that result and immediately passes it to \`f\`, returning the final value. The mathematical notation is \`f(g(x))\`.

  "closures-generator-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This conceptual problem compares two ways of maintaining state between function calls: closures and generators.
- **Closures**: Hold state in variables in their surrounding scope. The function can be called repeatedly to update and access this state.
- **Generators**: Hold state implicitly. Their "state" is where they are currently paused in their execution. Calling \`.next()\` resumes them.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
**Closure Example:**
\`\`\`javascript
function createCounter() { let i = 0; return () => i++; }
const counter = createCounter();
counter(); // 0
counter(); // 1

**Generator Example:**
\`\`\`javascript
function* counterGenerator() { let i = 0; while(true) yield i++; }
const gen = counterGenerator();
gen.next().value; // 0
gen.next().value; // 1
\`\`\`

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the relationship between closures and React Hooks. Hooks like \`useState\` and \`useEffect\` seem magical, but they rely on closures to work.

\`\`\`javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // The 'setCount' function is a closure.
  // It "remembers" which component instance it belongs to,

  "closures-undo-functionality": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem requires creating a state manager that can remember its history. A closure is the perfect tool to store this history privately.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createHistory\` factory initializes a private \`history\` array with the initial value.
2.  It returns an object with methods. These methods are closures over the \`history\` array.
3.  \`setValue\` pushes a new state onto the history array.
4.  \`undo\` removes the last state, but it is careful not to empty the array completely.
5.  \`getValue\` simply returns the current state, which is always the last item in the array.

1.  The \`outer\` function has a \`defaultParam\` with a default value.
2.  When \`outer()\` is called without arguments, \`defaultParam\` is initialized to its default string.

This problem shows that variables created via destructuring assignment are just like any other variables in that scope. They become part of the lexical environment and can be captured by closures.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`outer\` function has a parameter \`config\` which is an object.
2.  Inside \`outer\`, we use destructuring: \`const { enabled, mode } = config;\`. This creates two new block-scoped constants, \`enabled\` and \`mode\`.
3.  These new constants are part of \`outer\`'s lexical environment.
4.  The returned inner function is a closure that captures \`enabled\` and \`mode\` from this environment.

  "closures-memory-leak-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a potential downside of closures if not managed carefully. A memory leak occurs when memory is no longer needed by the application but cannot be reclaimed by the garbage collector. A closure can cause this if it stays alive for a long time (e.g., as an event listener or in a global variable) and holds a reference to a very large object that is no longer needed for any other purpose.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Imagine an event listener on a button that never gets removed.
\`\`\`javascript
function setupListener() {
  const largeDataObject = new Array(1e6).fill('*'); // A large object
  const button = document.getElementById('my-button');
  
  // This event listener is a closure.
  // It uses 'largeDataObject'.
  button.addEventListener('click', function handler() {
    console.log(largeDataObject.length);
  });
  
  // If the button is removed from the DOM but the listener isn't,
  // the 'handler' closure might stay alive, keeping 'largeDataObject' in memory.
}
\`\`\`
The key is that the closure keeps the large object "reachable" for the garbage collector, even if the rest of the application has forgotten about it. The solution is proper cleanup, like calling \`removeEventListener\`.

This problem extends the concept of memoization. Instead of caching a result forever, we want to cache it for a limited time (a "Time To Live" or TTL). This requires the closure to store not just the result, but also the time at which it was cached.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The HOF \`memoizeWithExpiration\` takes the function and a \`ttl\` in milliseconds.
2.  The private \`cache\` now stores objects containing both the \`value\` and an \`expiry\` timestamp.
3.  When the memoized function is called, it gets the current time, \`now\`.
4.  It checks if a cached entry exists *and* if \`now\` is still before the entry's \`expiry\` time.
5.  If both are true, it returns the cached value.
6.  Otherwise, it calculates a new result, and stores it in the cache along with a new expiry time (\`now + ttl\`).
\`\`\`javascript
const memoizeWithExpiration = (fn, ttl) => {

  "closures-global-scope-pollution": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem contrasts the old practice of declaring many variables in the global scope with the modern practice of containing them within a private scope using an IIFE or, more commonly now, an ES6 module. Global variables are bad because they can be accidentally overwritten by other scripts on the page, leading to hard-to-debug conflicts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
**Before (Bad):**
\`\`\`javascript
// All these variables are attached to the global 'window' object.
var config = { setting: true };
var data = [1, 2, 3];
function processData() { /* ... */ }
\`\`\`
**After (Good, using IIFE):**
\`\`\`javascript
(function() {
  // These variables are private to this scope and do not pollute the global scope.
  var config = { setting: true };
  var data = [1, 2, 3];
  function processData() { /* ... */ }
})();
\`\`\`
The IIFE creates a "sandbox" for your code, protecting both your code from the global scope and the global scope from your code.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Global Scope**: The outermost scope. Variables here are accessible everywhere.
- **Scope Pollution**: The problem of unintentionally creating global variables.
- **IIFE**: A primary tool for creating private scopes before ES6 modules.

  "closures-function-context-binding": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem compares two common ways to ensure a function is called with the correct \`this\` context, especially for callbacks.
1.  **Closure with Arrow Function**: An arrow function lexically captures the \`this\` from its surrounding scope.
2.  **\`.bind()\` Method**: The \`.bind()\` method creates a *new* function that, when called, has its \`this\` keyword set to the provided value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {
  name: 'My Object',
  createCallback: function () {
    // Arrow function captures 'this' from createCallback, which is 'obj'.
    return () => this.name;
  },
  createBoundCallback: function () {
    // .bind creates a new function with 'this' permanently set to 'obj'.
    const regularFn = function () { return this.name; };
    return regularFn.bind(this);
  },
};

Both techniques achieve the same result. The arrow function pattern is generally considered more modern and concise, while \`.bind()\` is more explicit and was the standard before ES6.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The callback functions you pass to \`.then()\` and \`.catch()\` are closures. This means they can access variables from the scope where the promise chain was defined.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`runChain\` function defines a local variable \`outerVar\`.
2.  A promise chain is started.
3.  The first \`.then()\` callback is a closure. It's inside \`runChain\`, so it can access \`outerVar\`.
4.  The second \`.then()\` callback is also a closure defined inside \`runChain\`, so it can also access the very same \`outerVar\`.

  "closures-debounce-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Debouncing is a technique to limit the rate at which a function gets called. A debounced function will only execute after a specific amount of time has passed *without it being called again*. This is useful for events that fire rapidly, like resizing a window or typing in a search bar.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A closure is used to store the \`timeoutId\` from \`setTimeout\`.
1.  The \`debounce\` HOF takes the function \`fn\` and a \`delay\`.
2.  It creates a private \`timeoutId\` variable.
3.  It returns a new function. This function is a closure over \`timeoutId\`.
4.  When called, it first clears any previously scheduled timeout using \`clearTimeout(timeoutId)\`.
5.  Then, it schedules the \`fn\` to run after \`delay\` milliseconds, storing the new timeout ID.
6.  If it's called again within the delay, the previous timeout is cancelled (step 4) and a new one is set, effectively resetting the timer.
\`\`\`javascript
const debounce = (fn, delay) => {
  let timeoutId;
  return (...args) => {

  "closures-throttle-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Throttling is another rate-limiting technique. A throttled function will execute at most once every specified time period. It ensures a function is called at a regular interval, not more frequently. This is useful for things like handling scroll events.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A closure is used to store a "cooldown" flag.
1.  The \`throttle\` HOF takes the function \`fn\` and a \`limit\`.
2.  It creates a private flag, \`inCooldown\`, initialized to \`false\`.
3.  It returns a new function that is a closure over \`inCooldown\`.
4.  When called, it checks the flag. If \`inCooldown\` is \`true\`, it does nothing.
5.  If \`inCooldown\` is \`false\`, it executes \`fn\`, sets \`inCooldown\` to \`true\`, and then uses \`setTimeout\` to reset the flag to \`false\` after the \`limit\` has passed.
\`\`\`javascript
const throttle = (fn, limit) => {
  let inCooldown = false;

  "closures-id-generator": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic function factory problem. We need a way to create functions that can generate unique, sequential IDs. Each generator should have its own independent counter and a specific prefix.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The factory function \`createIdGenerator\` takes a \`prefix\` as an argument.
2.  Inside the factory, a private counter variable \`id\` is initialized to 0. This variable will be unique to each generator created.
3.  The factory returns a new function. This function is a closure that "remembers" both its own private \`id\` counter and the \`prefix\` it was created with.
4.  Each time the returned function is called, it increments its private \`id\` and returns the formatted string.

This is a higher-order function that rearranges the arguments of another function. A "binary" function is one that takes two arguments. We need to create a wrapper that calls the original function but with the two arguments swapped.

1.  The \`flip\` HOF takes the original binary function \`fn\` as its argument.
2.  It returns a new function. This new function is a closure that remembers the original \`fn\`.

This problem requires creating a function that produces the next number in an arithmetic sequence (a sequence where the difference between consecutive terms is constant). This is a perfect use case for a closure to maintain the "current" number in the sequence.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The factory function \`createSequence\` takes the \`start\` value and the constant \`step\`.
2.  It initializes a private \`current\` variable. To make the first call return the \`start\` value, we initialize \`current\` to \`start - step\`.
3.  It returns a new function. This function is a closure over \`current\` and \`step\`.

This is an application of the Module Pattern where we need to expose a function that can be passed around as a callback, but also provide a way to get metadata about that function (its call count).

1.  The \`trackCalls\` factory creates a private \`count\` variable.
2.  It returns an object containing two methods that share a closure over the same \`count\`.
3.  The \`fn\` method's only job is to increment the shared counter. This is the function you would pass as a callback.

  "closures-with-try-catch": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem explores how scopes are created and how closures capture them. A \`try\` block, like any other block enclosed in \`{}\`, creates a new scope for variables declared with \`let\` or \`const\`. A closure created inside that block can capture variables from the scopes *outside* the \`try...catch\` structure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An \`outerVar\` is declared.
2.  A \`try\` block is entered.
3.  Inside the \`try\` block, a function is assigned to \`myClosure\`. This function is a closure.
4.  The closure's lexical environment is the scope *outside* the \`try\` block, so it correctly captures \`outerVar\`.
5.  An error is thrown, and the \`catch\` block is executed. This does not affect the closure that has already been created.
6.  After the \`try...catch\` block, when \`myClosure\` is called, it can still access the \`outerVar\` from its remembered environment.
\`\`\`javascript
let myClosure = () => {};
const outerVar = 'Success';
try {
  myClosure = () => \`Closure captured: \${outerVar}\`;
  throw new Error('Test Error');
} catch (e) {

  "closures-singleton-pattern": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Closures are a perfect way to implement this in JavaScript by hiding the instance in a private variable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  An IIFE is used to create a private scope.
2.  Inside this scope, a private variable \`instance\` is declared. It will hold the single instance once created.
3.  A private function \`createInstance\` defines how to create the object.
4.  The IIFE returns an object with a single public method, \`getInstance\`.
5.  \`getInstance\` is a closure over the \`instance\` variable. The first time it's called, it sees that \`instance\` is undefined, so it calls \`createInstance\` and stores the result.
6.  On all subsequent calls, it sees that \`instance\` already exists and simply returns the stored instance.
\`\`\`javascript
const Singleton = (function () {
  let instance;
  function createInstance() { return { id: Math.random() }; }

  "closures-dynamic-function-creation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a more dynamic version of the function factory. Instead of a few known variations, we want to create a function that can generate any number of specialized functions based on a string input.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solver uses the \`new Function()\` constructor. It's important to understand that this is generally **not recommended** due to major security risks (it can execute arbitrary strings as code) and performance issues (it can't be optimized by the engine). It also has a key difference regarding scope: **functions created with \`new Function()\` do not create closures over their creation environment; they only have access to the global scope.**

\`\`\`javascript
const createOperation = (operator) => {
  // 'a' and 'b' will be the arguments to the new function.
  // The third argument is the function body.
  return new Function('a', 'b', \`return a \${operator} b;\`);
};
const add = createOperation('+'); // Creates a function equivalent to (a, b) => a + b

  "closures-circular-reference-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A circular reference occurs when two or more objects hold references to each other, creating a cycle. In older, simpler garbage collection systems (like reference counting), this could cause a memory leak because each object's reference count would never drop to zero.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Closures can create these cycles.
\`\`\`javascript
function createCycle() {
  const obj = {};
  // The closure references 'obj'.
  const closure = () => obj;
  // 'obj' now references the closure.
  obj.fn = closure;
  return obj;
}
let myCycle = createCycle(); 
// Now myCycle.fn refers to a function that refers back to myCycle.

Modern JavaScript engines use a more advanced "mark-and-sweep" garbage collection algorithm. It works by finding all "reachable" objects starting from a root (like the global \`window\` object). If the entire cycle (\`myCycle\`) becomes unreachable (e.g., \`myCycle = null\`), the garbage collector can identify the whole group as garbage and clean it up, preventing a memory leak.

  "closures-with-async-await": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that closures work seamlessly with modern \`async/await\` syntax. An \`async\` function still has a lexical environment, and any functions defined within it can close over that environment, even across \`await\` suspension points.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`async function outer()\` is called. It defines \`outerVar\`.
2.  It hits \`await delay(10)\`. The function's execution is *paused*, but its lexical environment is preserved.
3.  After 10ms, execution resumes.
4.  The arrow function is created. It forms a closure over the preserved lexical environment, capturing \`outerVar\`.
5.  This closure is returned from the (now resolved) promise that \`outer()\` returned.
6.  When called, it correctly accesses the captured value.

The Publish/Subscribe (or "Pub/Sub") pattern is a messaging pattern where "publishers" send messages without knowing who the "subscribers" are. Subscribers express interest in specific messages ("events") and receive them when they are published. Closures are perfect for implementing this by managing the list of subscribers privately.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  The \`createPubSub\` factory creates a private \`subscribers\` object. This object will store arrays of callback functions, keyed by the event name.
2.  It returns a public API object.
3.  \`subscribe(event, callback)\`: This method adds a new callback function to the array for a given event.
4.  \`publish(event, data)\`: This method looks up the array of callbacks for an event and calls each one, passing along the data.

  "closures-lazy-evaluation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Lazy evaluation is a strategy where an expression is not evaluated until its value is actually needed. A "thunk" is a simple way to achieve this. It's a function that takes no arguments and wraps an expression to delay its evaluation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`createThunk\` function simulates creating a wrapper for an expensive operation. The \`expensiveData\` variable is part of the outer function's scope.
2. It returns a new function, the "thunk". This thunk is a closure that remembers the \`expensiveData\`.
3. The expensive operation (in this case, just defining the string) isn't truly "run" until the thunk itself is called. The solver uses a boolean flag \`executed\` to demonstrate this delay.

This problem shows another way the classic \`var\` loop problem could be solved before \`let\`. The \`Array.prototype.forEach\` method takes a callback function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. We call \`.forEach\` on an array.
2. For the first element (0), the callback \`function(i)\` is called. A new scope is created where \`i\` is 0. The \`setTimeout\` callback closes over this scope.
3. For the second element (1), a *new* call to the callback is made. A separate, new scope is created where \`i\` is 1. The second \`setTimeout\` callback closes over this second scope.
4. And so on. Each \`setTimeout\` callback has its own private scope with the correct value of \`i\`.
\`\`\`javascript
[0, 1, 2].forEach(function (i) {
  // This function is called 3 separate times,

2. This creates a private \`balance\` variable inside its scope.
3. It returns an object with public methods: \`deposit\`, \`withdraw\`, and \`getBalance\`.
4. \`deposit\` and \`withdraw\` are closures that can modify the private \`balance\`. The \`withdraw\` method includes logic to prevent overdrawing.

This problem demonstrates how a factory function can use a closure to "remember" a decision made at creation time. Based on an initial condition, the factory returns one function or another, and the caller of the factory doesn't need to know which version they received.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`createFn\` factory takes a boolean \`useNew\`.
2. Inside, two different functions, \`oldFn\` and \`newFn\`, are defined.
3. An \`if\` statement checks the \`useNew\` flag.
4. The factory returns either \`newFn\` or \`oldFn\`.

2. It also creates a \`methods\` object. This object will be the public API.
3. The methods (\`add\`, \`subtract\`) modify the private \`val\`. Crucially, they \`return methods\` to allow for chaining.

  "closures-lexical-environment-object": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a deep, conceptual problem about the inner workings of JavaScript. A "Lexical Environment" is not a physical object you can access, but a concept defined in the ECMAScript specification. It's the theoretical structure that holds the variables and functions for a given scope.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A lexical environment consists of two main components:
1.  **Environment Record**: This is where the variable and function declarations for the current scope are stored. It's like a dictionary or hash map. When you write \`let x = 10\`, an entry for \`x\` is created in the environment record.
2.  **Outer Environment Reference**: This is a link to the lexical environment of the parent scope. This link is what forms the scope chain. It's \`null\` for the global environment.

When a closure is created, it maintains a reference to the lexical environment in which it was defined.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **ECMAScript Specification**: The official standard that defines how JavaScript works.
- **Lexical Environment**: The specification's name for a scope object.

  "closures-iterator-with-closure": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem combines two concepts: the iterator protocol and closures. The iterator protocol requires an object with a \`.next()\` method. We can implement this by making the \`.next()\` method a closure that "remembers" its current position in the iteration.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`createRangeIterator\` factory takes a \`start\` and \`end\`.
2. It creates a private \`current\` variable, initialized to the \`start\` value.
3. It returns an iterator object.
4. The \`next\` method on this object is a closure. It has access to the private \`current\` and \`end\` variables.
5. Each time \`.next()\` is called, it checks if \`current\` has passed \`end\`. It returns the current value and then increments the private \`current\` variable, preserving its state for the next call.
\`\`\`javascript
function createRangeIterator(start, end) {
  let current = start; // State is kept in the closure
  return {
    next: () => {
      if (current <= end) {
        return { value: current++, done: false };

  "closures-access-log": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem requires creating a wrapper around an object that logs property access. This is a perfect use case for the \`Proxy\` object, and the proxy's handler can use a closure to maintain a private log.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
While the solver notes this is a conceptual fit for Proxies, we can implement a version of it using closures and a factory.
1. The factory takes the \`target\` object.
2. It creates a private \`log\` array.
3. It returns a new object with \`get\` and \`getLog\` methods.
4. The \`get(prop)\` method is a closure over \`target\` and \`log\`. It pushes the access to the log and then retrieves the property from the original \`target\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function createLoggedObject(target) {
  const log = [];
  return {
    get(prop) {
      log.push(\`Accessed '\${prop}' at \${new Date().toISOString()}\`);

  "closures-closures-vs-classes": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual comparison of two ways to achieve encapsulation in JavaScript.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
**Closure / Module Pattern:**
-   **Privacy**: Provides "hard" privacy. Variables are truly inaccessible from the outside.
-   **Mechanism**: Uses function scope.
-   **Methods**: Each instance gets its own copy of the methods, which can use more memory.
\`\`\`javascript
function createCounter() {
  let count = 0;
  return { increment: () => count++ };
}
\`\`\`
**ES6 Class with Private Fields:**
-   **Privacy**: Also provides hard privacy, enforced by the language syntax (\`#\`).
-   **Mechanism**: Built into the class syntax. Methods are typically placed on the prototype.
-   **Methods**: Methods are shared via the prototype, which is more memory efficient for many instances.
\`\`\`javascript
class Counter {
  #count = 0;
  increment() { this.#count++; }
}
\`\`\`
For modern JavaScript, classes are generally the preferred, more idiomatic, and more efficient way to create object-oriented structures. Closures are excellent for standalone utilities, factories, and managing state in functional patterns.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Encapsulation**: The core goal of both patterns.

  "closures-retry-operation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a practical higher-order function for handling unreliable asynchronous operations (like network requests). We need a wrapper that calls an async function and, if it fails, tries again a specified number of times.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The conceptual implementation would use closures to track the attempt count and an async loop.
1. The \`retry\` HOF takes the async function \`fn\` and a \`retries\` count.
2. It returns a new \`async\` function. This function uses a closure to remember \`fn\` and \`retries\`.
3. Inside, a \`for\` loop runs up to the \`retries\` count.
4. A \`try...catch\` block wraps the \`await fn(...args)\` call.
5. If it succeeds, the loop is exited, and the result is returned.
6. If it fails, the \`catch\` block catches the error. If it's the last attempt, the error is re-thrown. Otherwise, the loop continues to the next attempt.
\`\`\`javascript
const retry = (fn, retries) => {
  return async (...args) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < retries; i++) {
      try {

  "closures-timed-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a higher-order function that acts as a "decorator" or "wrapper" to add functionality (timing) to an existing function without modifying it. This is a common pattern in programming for cross-cutting concerns like logging or performance measurement.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`time\` HOF takes the function \`fn\` to be measured.
2. It returns a new function. This new function is a closure that remembers the original \`fn\`.
3. When the new function is called, it first records the start time using \`performance.now()\`.
4. It then calls the original function \`fn\`, passing through any arguments using the rest/spread syntax (\`...args\`).
5. It captures the return value of \`fn\`.
6. It records the end time and logs the difference.
7. Finally, it returns the original function's result, so the wrapping is transparent.
\`\`\`javascript
const time = (fn) => {
  return (...args) => {
    const start = performance.now();
    const result = fn(...args);

  "closures-history-of-calls": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another decorator-style HOF. We want to wrap a function to record every set of arguments it has been called with. A closure is needed to maintain the private history array.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`withHistory\` HOF takes the original function \`fn\`.
2. It creates a private \`history\` array inside its scope.
3. It returns a new function, \`newFn\`. \`newFn\` is a closure over both \`fn\` and \`history\`.
4. When \`newFn\` is called, it pushes the \`args\` array into the \`history\` array.
5. It then calls the original \`fn\` and returns its result.
6. For convenience, the solver attaches the \`history\` array as a property on \`newFn\` itself, allowing external code to inspect it.

const withHistory = (fn) => {
  const history = [];

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is an advanced functional programming problem. We need to create a generic \`curry\` function that can take any function \`fn\` and allow its arguments to be passed one by one.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This requires recursion and closures.
1. The \`curry\` function takes the original function \`fn\`.
2. It returns a new function called \`curried\`. The \`curried\` function will be recursive.
3. \`curried\` is a closure over \`fn\` and also over the arguments it has collected so far.
4. When \`curried\` is called with new arguments, it concatenates them with any previously collected arguments.
5. It checks if the number of collected arguments is now greater than or equal to the number of arguments the original \`fn\` expects (\`fn.length\`).
6. If yes, it calls the original \`fn\` with all the collected arguments.
7. If not, it returns a *new* \`curried\` function that is a closure over the now-larger list of collected arguments, waiting for the rest.
\`\`\`javascript
const curry = (fn) => {
  return function curried(...args) {
    if (args.length >= fn.length) {

  "closures-lazy-array-mapping": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem combines the idea of lazy evaluation with the iterator protocol. We want to create an object that represents a "mapped" array, but the mapping calculation for each element should only happen when we ask for that specific element via a \`.next()\` call.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`lazyMap\` function takes an array \`arr\` and a \`mapFn\`.
2. It creates a private \`index\` variable to track the current position.
3. It returns an iterator object with a \`.next()\` method.
4. The \`.next()\` method is a closure over \`arr\`, \`mapFn\`, and \`index\`.
5. Each time \`.next()\` is called, it checks if it's past the end of the array.
6. If not, it takes the *current* element \`arr[index]\`, applies the \`mapFn\` to it *now*, increments the index, and returns the result. The mapping is done on-demand.
\`\`\`javascript
const lazyMap = (arr, mapFn) => {
  let index = 0;
  return {
    next: () => {
      if (index < arr.length) {

  "closures-with-web-workers-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the boundaries of closures. A Web Worker runs in a completely separate thread from the main UI thread. It has its own global scope and its own memory.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Because workers are in a different thread, you cannot directly pass a function, which is an object in memory, to a worker. When you use \`worker.postMessage(data)\`, the \`data\` is serialized (similar to \`JSON.stringify\`), sent to the worker, and then deserialized.
- **What doesn't work**: \`worker.postMessage({ myClosure: () => myVar })\`. The function and its closed-over environment cannot be serialized.
- **What does work**: You can send the *code* of the function as a string, and the worker can use \`eval\` or \`new Function()\` to execute it. However, it will not have access to the original lexical environment; it will only have access to the worker's own global scope.

1. The \`createAlphabetGen\` factory is created.
2. Inside its scope, a private variable \`charCode\` is initialized to \`65\`, which is the ASCII/Unicode value for the character 'A'.
3. It returns a new function. This function is a closure over \`charCode\`.
4. Each time the returned function is called, it uses \`String.fromCharCode()\` to convert the current \`charCode\` to a letter, and then increments \`charCode\` for the next call.

This problem demonstrates how a closure can be used to provide a persistent "memory" or cache for a recursive function, allowing you to implement memoization without passing the cache around as a parameter.

1. The \`createMemoizedFib\` factory function is the key. It creates the private \`cache\` object.
2. It then defines the recursive \`fib\` function *inside* the factory.
3. Because \`fib\` is defined inside the factory, it is a closure and has access to the \`cache\`.
4. The recursive calls are to itself (\`fib(n-1)\`), so they all share the same closure over the same \`cache\` object.

This is a more advanced version of memoization. When a function takes multiple arguments, using \`JSON.stringify\` as a cache key can be slow. A more performant approach for a fixed number of arguments is to use a nested cache structure, where each level of the cache corresponds to an argument.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The conceptual approach for a two-argument function:
1. The closure would hold a top-level cache (e.g., a \`Map\`).
2. When called with \`(arg1, arg2)\`, it looks up \`arg1\` in the top-level cache.
3. If \`arg1\` is not found, it creates a new empty \`Map\` for it.
4. The value associated with \`arg1\` is the second-level cache.
5. It then looks up \`arg2\` in this second-level cache.
6. If found, it returns the value. If not, it computes the result, stores it in the second-level cache, and returns it.

2. It defines a \`handler\` object for the proxy.
3. The \`get\` trap inside the handler is a closure. It has access to the \`metadata\` object from its parent scope.
4. Each time a property is accessed on the proxy, the \`get\` trap fires and increments the private \`metadata.accessCount\`.
5. The factory returns both the proxy and a \`getAccessCount\` function (also a closure) that allows reading the private metadata.

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a model of computation that can be in exactly one of a finite number of "states" at any given time.

This is a conceptual problem about the nature of ES6 modules. The goal is to have a single, application-wide cache that any part of the code can import and use.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
ES6 modules are singletons by nature. The code in a module file is executed only once, the first time it is imported anywhere in the application. Subsequent imports of the same module will receive a reference to the same, already-created module instance.

The problem is if \`myObj\` happened to have a property named \`x\`. Then \`with (myObj)\` would cause the inner function to resolve to \`myObj.x\` instead of the closed-over \`x\`, breaking the lexical scope. This ambiguity is why \`with\` is deprecated.

  "closures-tap-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`tap\` function is a small utility from functional programming. Its purpose is to "tap into" a sequence of operations (like a method chain) to perform a side effect, such as logging a value at a certain point, without interrupting the flow of the main operation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The implementation is very simple.
1. It takes a \`value\` and a function \`fn\`.
2. It immediately calls \`fn(value)\`. This is the side effect.
3. Crucially, it then returns the original, unmodified \`value\`. This allows it to be inserted into a chain of calls without changing the final result.
\`\`\`javascript
const tap = (value, fn) => {
  fn(value); // Perform the side effect
  return value; // Return the original value
};

// Example usage in a chain
const result = [1, 2, 3]
  .map(x => x * 10)
  .filter(x => x > 15)
  .map(x => tap(x, val => console.log(\`After filter: \${val}\`))) // Tap to log
  .reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
\`\`\`
The closure aspect is subtle: the function \`fn\` passed to \`tap\` is often a closure itself, able to access variables from the scope where the chain is being executed.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Side Effects**: Actions that interact with the outside world (like logging).
- **Functional Programming**: A utility for debugging and inspecting data flows.

  "closures-accumulating-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem requires a stateful function that accumulates values over time. It's similar to the counter, but instead of just incrementing, it adds a given value to its internal state.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`createAccumulator\` factory takes an \`initialValue\`.
2. It creates a private state variable \`total\`, initialized with \`initialValue\`.
3. It returns a new function. This new function is a closure over the \`total\` variable.
4. When the new function is called with a \`num\`, it adds that \`num\` to the private \`total\` and returns the new \`total\`. The state is preserved for the next call.
\`\`\`javascript
const createAccumulator = (initialValue) => {
  let total = initialValue;
  return (num) => {
    total += num;
    return total;
  };

  "closures-closures-in-jsonp-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a historical web technique. JSONP (JSON with Padding) was a workaround for the browser's same-origin policy to fetch data from a different domain. It works by dynamically creating a \`<script>\` tag. Closures are essential for handling the response.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. Your code wants to fetch data. It generates a unique callback function name, e.g., \`jsonp_callback_123\`.
2. It defines this function on the global scope: \`window.jsonp_callback_123 = function(data) { ... }\`. This function is a **closure**. It knows which part of your application is waiting for the data.
3. It creates a script tag: \`<script src="https://api.example.com/data?callback=jsonp_callback_123"></script>\`.
4. The server receives the request, wraps the JSON data in a call to that function, and sends back JavaScript code: \`jsonp_callback_123({"name": "Alice"})\`.
5. The browser executes this script, calling your globally defined closure with the data.
6. The closure then resolves the promise or calls the original handler in your application, and cleans up the script tag and the global function.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **JSONP**: A historical technique for cross-domain data fetching.
- **Dynamic Script Injection**: The core mechanism of JSONP.
- **Closures**: Used to bridge the gap between the global callback and the application code waiting for the data.

  "closures-lifecycle-events": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem involves implementing a basic event emitter pattern on an existing object. We want to add \`on\` (to subscribe) and \`trigger\` (to publish) methods. A closure is needed to manage the private list of event listeners associated with the object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is another application of the Pub/Sub pattern.
1. The \`withLifecycle\` HOF takes an object to be enhanced.
2. It creates a private \`listeners\` object within its scope.
3. It adds \`on\` and \`trigger\` methods to the original object.
4. \`on(event, callback)\`: This is a closure over \`listeners\`. It adds the \`callback\` to the array for the given \`event\`.
5. \`trigger(event, data)\`: This is also a closure over \`listeners\`. It finds all callbacks for the given \`event\` and executes them.
\`\`\`javascript
function withLifecycle(obj) {
  const listeners = {};

  "closures-spread-args": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how to create a "pass-through" wrapper function that can accept any number of arguments and pass them along to the original function. This is essential for creating generic higher-order functions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`withLogging\` HOF takes the original function \`fn\`.
2. It returns a new function. This new function uses **rest parameters** (\`...args\`) to collect all arguments passed to it into a single array named \`args\`.
3. It can then perform its side effect (logging the \`args\` array).
4. Finally, it uses the **spread syntax** (\`...args\`) to "unpack" the \`args\` array back into individual arguments when calling the original function \`fn\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const withLogging = (fn) => {
  // Use rest parameters to collect all arguments

  "closures-closures-in-nodejs-streams-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a core Node.js pattern. Node.js streams are event emitters that process data in chunks. When you attach a listener, like \`readableStream.on('data', callback)\`, that \`callback\` function is a closure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Imagine you are calculating the total size of a file being downloaded.
\`\`\`javascript
// in some function scope
let totalSize = 0;
const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('large-file.zip');

// The callback is a closure. It closes over 'totalSize'.

This is a practical application of the Module Pattern for managing application configuration, specifically feature flags (toggles that turn features on or off). The state of the flags must be private and only manageable through the module's API.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`createFlagManager\` factory creates a private \`flags\` object to store the state of all flags.
2. It returns an object with public methods that form a closure over the \`flags\` object.
3. \`setFlag(name, val)\`: This method modifies the private \`flags\` object.

  "closures-polyfill-bind-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about recreating a built-in JavaScript function. A "polyfill" is code that provides modern functionality on older browsers that don't support it natively. To polyfill \`Function.prototype.bind\`, we need to replicate its behavior using older JavaScript features, primarily closures.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`.bind(thisArg, arg1, arg2, ...)\` returns a *new function* that, when called, has its \`this\` value set to \`thisArg\` and its initial arguments set to \`arg1\`, \`arg2\`, etc.
1. We'd add a function to \`Function.prototype\`.
2. This function would capture the original function it's being called on (\`this\`, which we'll call \`originalFn\`).
3. It would also capture the \`thisArg\` and any "pre-filled" arguments (\`boundArgs\`).
4. It would return a new function. This new function is a **closure** over \`originalFn\`, \`thisArg\`, and \`boundArgs\`.
5. When this new function is eventually called with its own arguments (\`callArgs\`), it would use \`.apply()\` to invoke the \`originalFn\`, setting the context to \`thisArg\` and passing a combined list of \`boundArgs\` and \`callArgs\`.

  "closures-async-data-loader": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem combines the module pattern with asynchronous operations. The goal is to create a data loader that fetches data only once and then serves it from a private cache on all subsequent calls. This is a common performance optimization.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The factory function creates a private \`cache\` variable, initialized to be empty.
2. It returns an \`async\` function. This function is a closure over the \`cache\`.
3. When the function is called, it first checks if the \`cache\` is populated. If it is, it immediately returns the cached data.
4. If the cache is empty, it proceeds to make the \`fetch\` call.
5. In the \`.then()\` block of the fetch, it stores the fetched data in the private \`cache\` variable.
6. Finally, it returns the data. All subsequent calls will hit the condition in step 3.
\`\`\`javascript
const createDataLoader = (url) => {
  let cache; // Private cache
  return async () => {

  "closures-closures-in-web-components-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about Web Components (specifically Custom Elements). A custom element is defined using an ES6 class. The methods and event listeners defined within that class are closures.

\`\`\`javascript
class MyComponent extends HTMLElement {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.count = 0; // Instance property

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem involves creating a \`pipeline\` function, which is a form of function composition. It takes a series of functions and chains them together, where the output of one becomes the input of the next.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. The \`pipeline\` function uses rest parameters (\`...funcs\`) to accept any number of functions.
2. It returns a new function. This new function is a closure that remembers the array of \`funcs\`.
3. This new function takes an \`initialValue\`.
4. It uses the \`Array.prototype.reduce\` method to execute the pipeline. \`reduce\` iterates over the \`funcs\` array.
5. The \`initialValue\` serves as the starting \`accumulator\` for \`reduce\`.
6. For each \`fn\` in the \`funcs\` array, \`reduce\` calls \`fn(accumulator)\`, and the result becomes the new \`accumulator\` for the next iteration.

  "closures-execution-context-vs-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a core conceptual problem that distinguishes two related but different ideas.
- **Scope (Lexical Environment)**: Is **static** and **author-time**. It's created by the physical nesting of functions in your code. It defines *which variables a function has access to*.
- **Execution Context**: Is **dynamic** and **run-time**. A new execution context is created every time a function is **called**. It contains information about the current execution, such as the value of \`this\`, the arguments, and a reference to the function's scope (its lexical environment).

  let myVar = 2;
  // The SCOPE of inner is here. It has access to outer's myVar (2).

  "closures-dependency-injection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where an object or function receives its dependencies (the other objects or functions it needs to work with) from an outside source, rather than creating them itself. Closures are a natural way to implement this in JavaScript.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. We have a "dependency" or "service," like a \`logger\`.
2. The \`createHandler\` function is a factory that accepts the \`logger\` as an argument. This is the "injection" step.
3. It returns a new function, \`handler\`.
4. The \`handler\` is a closure. It doesn't know or care how the \`logger\` was created; it just knows it has access to a \`logger\` object from its lexical environment.
5. This decouples the \`handler\`'s logic from the specific implementation of the \`logger\`. We can easily pass in a different logger (e.g., a fake one for testing) without changing the handler's code.
\`\`\`javascript
// The dependency
const consoleLogger = { log: (msg) => console.log(msg) };

// The factory that "injects" the dependency

  "closures-closures-in-es6-modules": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This conceptual problem explains that ES6 modules provide a top-level scope that is *not* the global scope. This module scope is the foundation of privacy in modern JavaScript.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Consider a module file:
\`\`\`javascript
// --- file: counter.js ---

// 'count' exists in the private module scope, not on the global 'window' object.
let count = 0;

// This exported function is a closure.
// It closes over the private, module-scoped 'count' variable.
export function increment() {
  count++;
  return count;
}

export function getCount() {

When another file imports and uses these functions, they are interacting with the private \`count\` variable via the closures.
\`\`\`javascript
// --- file: main.js ---
import { increment, getCount } from './counter.js';

increment();
console.log(getCount()); // 1
// There is no way to access 'count' directly from main.js

1. The \`countdown\` factory takes the starting number \`n\`.
2. It creates a private \`current\` variable, initialized to \`n\`.
3. It returns a new function. This function is a closure over \`current\`.
4. Each time the returned function is called, it checks the value of \`current\`.
5. If \`current > 0\`, it returns the number and then decrements \`current\` (post-decrement \`current--\`).
6. If \`current === 0\`, it returns "Blastoff!" and decrements \`current\` so future calls will do nothing.
7. If \`current\` is already less than 0, it returns an empty string.

  "closures-hot-and-cold-observables": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem from reactive programming (like RxJS).
- **Cold Observable**: The producer of values is created inside the observable. Each time you subscribe, a new producer is created. It's like a YouTube video; each viewer starts from the beginning. Closures are key here, as each subscription gets its own function execution with its own private state.
- **Hot Observable**: The producer exists outside the observable and is shared. All subscribers listen to the same source. It's like a live TV broadcast; you tune in and see what's happening right now.

  "closures-closures-with-symbols": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem explores using an ES6 \`Symbol\` to create a "private" property key. While not truly private (it can be found via \`Reflect.ownKeys()\`), it's a way to create a property that won't collide with any other string-based keys and won't be revealed by methods like \`Object.keys()\` or \`JSON.stringify()\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`Symbol\` is created within the scope of a factory function. This symbol, \`privateKey\`, is private to the closure. The returned object has a public method that uses this private symbol to access a property on the object itself.

\`\`\`javascript
const createObj = () => {
  const privateKey = Symbol('private');
  const obj = {
    [privateKey]: 'secret data',
    reveal: () => obj[privateKey],
  };
  return obj;
};
\`\`\`
This pattern combines the uniqueness of symbols with the privacy of closures.

  "closures-closures-with-generators-and-next": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is an advanced problem showing the interplay between generators and closures. A generator can be paused with \`yield\`. When it's resumed with \`.next(value)\`, the value passed can be used by code inside the generator, including any closures defined there.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The generator \`createLogger\` creates a closure, the \`console.log\` statement. This closure can access the \`context\` variable from the generator's scope. The \`yield\` expression pauses the generator and waits for a value to be sent via \`.next()\`. When \`.next('USER_ACTION')\` is called, the \`context\` variable is updated, and the closure uses this new value in its log message.

\`\`\`javascript
function* createLogger() {
  let context = 'None';
  while (true) {
    const newContext = yield; // Pauses here

  "closures-immutable-state-manager": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem involves creating a simple state manager that adheres to the principle of immutability. Instead of modifying the existing state object, any update must create a brand new state object. This is a core concept in state management libraries like Redux.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`createStateManager\` function keeps the current \`state\` in its closure. The \`updateState\` method does not change the original \`state\` object. Instead, it uses the spread syntax \`{ ...state, ...updates }\` to create a new object. This new object is then assigned back to the private \`state\` variable. The strict inequality check (\`oldState !== newState\`) proves that a new object was created.

### üìö Key Concepts

  "closures-the-this-keyword-in-loops": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic JavaScript problem demonstrating the difference between \`function\` and arrow functions regarding the \`this\` keyword. A traditional \`function\` gets its own \`this\` value depending on how it's called. When used as a simple callback (like in \`.forEach\`), its \`this\` is often \`undefined\` (in strict mode). An arrow function does not have its own \`this\`; it lexically captures it from its surrounding scope.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Inside a class method, a \`.forEach\` loop is used.
- The callback with \`function() { this.process(...) }\` would fail because \`this\` inside the callback is not the class instance.
- The callback with \`() => { this.process(...) }\` works perfectly because the arrow function captures the \`this\` from the surrounding method, which correctly points to the class instance.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Dynamic \`this\`**: The \`this\` value in a regular function is determined at call time.

  "closures-lock-and-key": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to create a pair of functions that share a secret. One function ("the key") holds a secret reference, and the other ("the lock") will only grant access if it's given that exact same reference. This relies on the fact that object references are unique.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`createLock\` function creates a plain object, \`const key = {}\`. This object acts as a unique, unforgeable token. It is stored in the closure. It then returns two functions, \`lock\` and \`getKey\`. Both are closures that have access to the original \`key\`. The \`lock\` function will only succeed if the argument passed to it is strictly equal (\`===\`) to the original \`key\` object.

\`\`\`javascript
const createLock = () => {
  const key = {}; // Unique secret reference

  "closures-polling-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Polling means repeatedly performing an action at a regular interval. The task is to create a function that starts this polling behavior but also provides a way to stop it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`poll\` function uses \`setInterval\` to start the repeated execution. \`setInterval\` returns a unique ID for that interval. This ID is stored in a variable within the closure. The function then returns a \`stop\` function. This \`stop\` function is also a closure that has access to the \`intervalId\`. When called, it uses \`clearInterval\` with the captured ID to stop the polling.

\`\`\`javascript
const poll = (fn, interval) => {

  "closures-closures-in-error-handling": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that a \`.catch()\` block on a Promise is a callback function that also behaves as a closure. It can access variables from the scope where the promise chain was defined, not just the error object that is passed to it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An \`outerVar\` is defined. A promise is created and immediately rejected. The \`.catch()\` handler is a function defined in the same scope as \`outerVar\`. When the promise rejects and the \`.catch()\` handler is executed, it can successfully access \`outerVar\` through its closure to provide more context for the error.

\`\`\`javascript
const outerVar = 'Context for error';
Promise.reject('Oops')

This is a combination of the "run once" pattern and a rate-limiting concept. The goal is to create a function that can be called, but then enters a "cooldown" period during which it cannot be called again.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The returned function is a closure that holds a boolean flag, \`canCall\`.
1.  When the function is called, it first checks if \`canCall\` is \`true\`.
2.  If it is, it immediately sets \`canCall\` to \`false\` to block subsequent calls.
3.  It then uses \`setTimeout\` to schedule resetting \`canCall\` back to \`true\` after the timeout period.
4.  Finally, it executes the original function.
5.  If the function is called while \`canCall\` is \`false\`, it does nothing.

  "closures-dynamic-scope-vs-lexical-scope": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a core computer science concept.
- **Lexical Scope (Static Scope)**: This is what JavaScript uses. The scope of a variable is determined by where it is defined in the source code. An inner function can see its parent's variables because of how the code is physically nested. It's predictable.
- **Dynamic Scope**: In this model (used by languages like early Lisp), the scope is determined by the call stack at runtime. An inner function would see the variables of the function that *called* it, not the function that *defined* it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution from problem #154 ("Environment Captured on Creation") is the perfect demonstration of lexical scope. The closure remembers its definitional scope, not the scope from which it was called. If JavaScript had dynamic scope, that example would have returned "Inner".

  "closures-closures-in-bookmorklets-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A bookmarklet is JavaScript code stored in a bookmark that runs on the current webpage. When you run a bookmarklet, its code is executed in the global scope of that page. This is dangerous because your bookmarklet's variables (\`var myVar\`) could conflict with variables the page is already using (\`var myVar\`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
To solve this, the entire bookmarklet code is wrapped in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE).
\`\`\`javascript
javascript:(function(){
  // All your bookmarklet code here
  var myVar = 'This is safe';
  // ...

  "closures-settings-manager": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another example of the module pattern. The goal is to create a manager for application settings. The settings themselves should be stored in a private object within a closure, accessible only through the public methods \`get\`, \`set\`, and \`getAll\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`createSettings\` factory takes an initial settings object. It creates a private variable \`settings\` by copying the initial values. It then returns an object with methods. Each method is a closure that has access to the private \`settings\` object. The \`getAll\` method is careful to return a *copy* of the settings (\`{...settings}\`) to prevent the private object itself from being mutated from the outside.

  "closures-unary-function-adapter": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem presents a common JavaScript quirk. The \`Array.prototype.map\` method calls its callback with three arguments: \`(value, index, array)\`. The \`parseInt\` function, however, can take two arguments: \`(string, radix)\`. When you do \`.map(parseInt)\`, you're effectively calling \`parseInt('10', 0)\`, \`parseInt('10', 1)\`, etc. The second argument (the index) is misinterpreted as the radix, leading to incorrect results.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`unary(fn)\` higher-order function solves this. It returns a new function that is a closure over \`fn\`. This new function is designed to accept only one argument, \`arg\`, and calls the original \`fn\` with just that one argument, discarding any others.

\`\`\`javascript
const unary = (fn) => (arg) => fn(arg);
['10', '10', '10'].map(unary(parseInt)); // Now correctly calls parseInt('10') each time

  "closures-closures-in-server-middlewares": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a very common pattern in Node.js frameworks like Express.js. A middleware is a function that sits between the server and your route handler. Sometimes, you need to configure a middleware. This is often done with a factory function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Consider a logging middleware. You might want to configure its format.
\`\`\`javascript
// The factory function
function createLogger(options) {
  // The actual middleware function is returned
  // It's a closure that remembers the 'options'
  return function logger(req, res, next) {

The \`spyOn(fn)\` HOF creates several private variables in its closure: \`callCount\` and an array \`calls\`. It returns a new function, \`spy\`. When \`spy\` is called, it increments the counter, records the arguments, and then calls the original function \`fn\`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem is designed to make the concept of the scope chain explicit. When a variable is accessed, the JavaScript engine first looks in the current function's scope.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
We create five nested functions, \`L1\` through \`L5\`. The variable being accessed, \`L1_var\`, is only defined in the outermost function. The innermost function, \`L5\`, successfully accesses it by traversing the entire scope chain outwards (\`L5 -> L4 -> L3 -> L2 -> L1\`).

  "closures-hoisting-with-functions": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem clarifies two types of hoisting:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  A function \`createClosure\` creates a large object and returns a closure that uses it.
2.  \`let myClosure = createClosure()\` creates a reference to the closure, keeping the large object in memory.

  "closures-memoize-async-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Memoizing an async function is tricky. You can't just cache the final value, because multiple calls might happen while the first one is still pending. The correct approach is to cache the *Promise* itself.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The memoization function's closure holds a cache.
1. When called, it generates a cache key.
2. If a promise already exists in the cache for that key, it returns that stored promise immediately.
3. If not, it calls the original async function, stores the *newly created promise* in the cache, and then returns that promise.
This ensures that for a given set of arguments, the expensive async operation is only ever started once. All subsequent calls get the same pending promise.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Async Memoization**: A more complex form of memoization that handles promises.
- **Race Conditions**: This pattern prevents race conditions where the same async operation is fired off multiple times.

  "closures-closures-and-prototypal-inheritance": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual comparison of two ways to create objects with "private" data and methods in JavaScript.
- **Prototypal Inheritance (Constructors/Classes)**: Methods are placed on the \`.prototype\` object and shared by all instances, which is memory efficient. Traditionally, properties were public (\`this.prop\`). Modern classes add true privacy with \`#prop\`.
- **Closures (Factory Functions)**: Both properties and methods are recreated for every single instance. This uses more memory but provides true privacy for the captured variables.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A class is defined, and a factory function is defined. The comparison highlights that the class instance shares its methods via the prototype, while each object from the factory has its own copy of the methods.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Prototypal Inheritance**: JavaScript's primary mechanism for object-oriented programming.
- **Factory Function**: A function that returns an object, often using closures for privacy.

  "closures-lazy-data-initialization": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This pattern is used for performance optimization. If you have a resource that is expensive to create (e.g., establishing a database connection, parsing a large file) and might not be needed, you can defer its creation until the first time it's actually requested.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The module uses a closure to hold a \`resource\` variable, initially null. The public \`getResource\` method checks if the resource has been initialized. If not, it performs the expensive creation process, stores the result in the \`resource\` variable, and then returns it. Subsequent calls will find the resource already created and return it immediately.

\`\`\`javascript
const createLazy = () => {
  let resource;
  return {
    getResource: () => {

  "closures-object-pool": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An object pool is a performance pattern used to manage a "pool" of objects that are expensive to create. Instead of creating and destroying objects frequently, you "acquire" an object from the pool when you need one and "release" it back to the pool when you're done.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A closure is used to manage a private array of available objects.
- \`acquire()\`: Checks the private array. If an object is available, it's removed from the array and returned. If not, a new one is created.
- \`release(obj)\`: Pushes the object back into the private array, making it available for the next \`acquire()\` call.
This reduces the strain on the garbage collector by reusing objects.

When you set up these event handlers, they are callback functions. These callbacks are closures.
\`\`\`javascript
function setupWebSocket(userId) {
  const socket = new WebSocket('ws://...');

The \`callable(fn)\` HOF creates a closure over a variable \`currentFn\`, initially set to the passed-in \`fn\`. The returned wrapper function checks \`typeof currentFn\` before attempting to call it.

This is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass a request along a chain of potential handlers. Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Closures can be used to build the chain. Each handler function in the chain can be a closure that holds a reference to the \`next\` handler.
\`\`\`javascript

  "closures-closures-over-getters-setters": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that a closure doesn't just capture the static value of a variable at creation time. If the "variable" is actually a property with a getter, the closure will call the getter each time it needs the value, getting the most up-to-date result.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An object \`person\` is created with a \`name\` getter. A \`greeter\` function is created, which is a closure over the \`person\` object. When the underlying property \`_name\` is changed, the next call to \`greeter\` invokes the \`person.name\` getter again, which reads the new value of \`_name\` and returns the updated full name. The closure maintains a live link to the object and its properties.

This is a variation of the memoization pattern. Instead of just caching a single result for a function, the goal is to cache the result for each unique set of arguments the function is called with.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The higher-order function maintains a private \`cache\` object in its closure. When the returned function is called, it creates a cache \`key\` by stringifying its arguments. It checks if this key exists in the cache. If so, it returns the cached value. If not, it calls the original function, stores the result in the cache at that key, and then returns the result.

  "closures-global-variable-shadowing": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Variable shadowing occurs when a variable declared in a certain scope (e.g., a local scope) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. When this happens, the inner variable takes precedence within its scope. This problem shows how a closure will correctly reference the shadowed variable, not the global one.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A global variable \`name\` is declared. The \`outer\` function also declares a variable called \`name\`. According to the scope chain, when the inner function (the closure) looks for \`name\`, it will find the one in its parent (\`outer\`) scope first and stop searching. It never reaches the global one.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Scope Chain**: Variable lookup starts at the innermost scope and works its way out.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Circuit Breaker is a design pattern used in distributed systems to prevent a network or service failure from cascading. After a number of consecutive failures, the breaker "trips" and for a subsequent period, all calls to the service will fail immediately, without making a network request. This gives the failing service time to recover.

A conceptual implementation would use a closure to hold the state: \`failureCount\`, \`state\` ('CLOSED', 'OPEN', 'HALF-OPEN'), and a timer ID.
- The returned function wraps the original async function.
- If the state is 'OPEN', it rejects immediately.
- If 'CLOSED', it calls the function. On success, it resets \`failureCount\`. On failure, it increments the count. If the count exceeds a threshold, it changes the state to 'OPEN' and starts a timeout.
- When the timeout fires, it changes the state to 'HALF-OPEN', allowing one test call to go through.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a classic pattern for achieving truly private data in JavaScript before the introduction of native private fields (\`#\`). It uses a \`WeakMap\` defined outside the class to associate private data with each class instance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`WeakMap\` named \`privateData\` is created in a closure outside the class.
- In the class \`constructor\`, we use \`privateData.set(this, { ... })\`. Here, the instance itself (\`this\`) is the key, and an object of private properties is the value.
- In a class method, we use \`privateData.get(this)\` to retrieve the private property bag for that specific instance.
Because the \`WeakMap\` is outside the class, the data is completely inaccessible from the outside.

Variables declared in the top-level scope of a service worker script are effectively the worker's state. Event handlers like \`self.addEventListener('fetch', ...)\` are closures that can access this top-level state. Because the worker can be terminated, this state is not permanent. However, for the lifetime of a single worker instance, closures are the primary mechanism for event handlers to access configuration and state, like a cache version name.

- **Service Workers**: A technology for enabling offline experiences and background features.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: The service worker responds to lifecycle and network events.

  "closures-lazy-getter-pattern": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a performance optimization pattern. It's similar to lazy initialization but implemented using a getter property on an object. The expensive computation to get a property's value is deferred until the very first time that property is accessed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The factory function creates a private variable \`_expensive\` in its closure, which will serve as the cache. It returns an object with a getter for the \`expensive\` property. The first time \`obj.expensive\` is accessed, the getter function runs, sees that \`_expensive\` is not yet set, performs the computation, stores the result in \`_expensive\`, and returns it. All subsequent accesses to \`obj.expensive\` will find a value in \`_expensive\` and return it immediately.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Getters**: A function that executes on property read access.
- **Lazy Evaluation**: Deferring computation until a value is needed.

  "closures-closures-in-destructuring-defaults": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows that the default value expression in a destructuring assignment is only evaluated if the property is missing. If that expression is a function call which returns another function, a closure is only created when the default is actually needed.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`getDefault\` function returns a new closure each time it's called.
- In the first destructuring, \`{ cb = getDefault() } = {}\`, the \`cb\` property is missing, so \`getDefault()\` is called, and \`cb\` becomes a new closure.
- In the second, \`{ cb2 = getDefault() } = { cb2: ... }\`, the property exists, so \`getDefault()\` is never called.

### üìö Key Concepts

  "closures-private-slots-in-custom-elements": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem that mirrors the "Private Property Bag" pattern but applies it specifically to Web Components (Custom Elements). Before native private class fields were widely supported, this was the go-to pattern for creating private state for component instances.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
You would create a module-level \`WeakMap\`. In the Custom Element's \`constructor\`, you would use \`this\` (the element instance) as the key to set an object of private properties in the \`WeakMap\`. Any methods on the element that needed to access this private state would use \`this\` to look up their private "slot" in the \`WeakMap\`. The closure is over the \`WeakMap\` itself.

  "closures-state-reducer-pattern": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The reducer pattern is a core concept in state management libraries like Redux. A "reducer" is a pure function that takes the current state and an "action" and returns the *new* state. A "store" is an object that holds the state and uses the reducer to update it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`createStore\` factory function is a perfect example of closures.
- It creates a private \`state\` variable in its closure.
- The returned \`getState\` method is a closure that can read the private \`state\`.
- The returned \`dispatch\` method is a closure that takes an action, calls the reducer with the current state and the action, and then assigns the result back to the private \`state\` variable.
This pattern encapsulates the state and ensures it can only be updated in a predictable way via the reducer.

  "closures-revisiting-lexical-vs-dynamic-this": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem is a stress test of understanding \`this\`.
- A regular function (\`method1\`) called on an object (\`obj.method1()\`) has its \`this\` set to that object.
- An arrow function (\`method2\`) defined inside that regular function will lexically capture the \`this\` of its parent. In this case, it captures the \`this\` from \`method1\`, which is the original \`obj\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The deeply nested arrow function correctly logs the name from the outermost object because its \`this\` was determined lexically, not by the immediate parent object (\`{ name: 'L2' }\`) that it was a property of. It demonstrates the power and predictability of lexical \`this\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Lexical \`this\`**: Arrow functions capture \`this\` from their defining context.
- **Scope Chain vs. \`this\`**: Variable lookup and \`this\` resolution are separate mechanisms.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
CSS-in-JS libraries (like Styled Components or Emotion) solve the problem of global CSS scope collisions. They do this by generating unique class names for each component's styles.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Conceptually, a function like \`styled('div')\` is a factory. It runs once when the component is defined.
1. It generates a unique class name (e.g., \`css-a1b2c3\`).
2. It injects the corresponding CSS rules into the document's stylesheet.
3. It returns a new React component.
This component is a closure. It "remembers" the unique class name and automatically applies it to the element it renders. This ensures the styles are perfectly scoped to just that component.

"Promisifying" is the process of converting a function that uses the older, callback-based convention for async operations (especially the Node.js \`(error, result)\` style) into a modern function that returns a Promise.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`promisify(fn)\` HOF returns a new function. This new function is a closure over the original \`fn\`. When called, it immediately returns a \`new Promise\`. Inside the promise executor, it calls the original \`fn\`, but provides its own custom callback. This custom callback is another closure. It will either \`reject\` the promise if the \`err\` argument is present, or \`resolve\` it with the \`data\` argument.

  "closures-chainable-api-with-async": `
<h3>üí° Problem Breakdown</h3>
<p>This is an advanced problem combining the fluent (chainable) API pattern with asynchronous operations. The key challenge is that each method call must return the main object to allow chaining (e.g., <code>obj.wait(100).log('done')</code>), but it must also correctly sequence the asynchronous operations. Simply returning the promise from each method would break the chain.</p>

<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough</h3>
<p>The solution uses a closure to manage a single <code>promiseChain</code> variable, which is initialized to a resolved promise (<code>Promise.resolve()</code>). Each chainable method (like <code>wait</code> or <code>log</code>) does three things:</p>
<ol>
    <li>It schedules its own asynchronous work by appending a new <code>.then()</code> to the <em>current</em> <code>promiseChain</code>.</li>
    <li>It reassigns the result of this <code>.then()</code> call back to the <code>promiseChain</code> variable, extending the chain.</li>
    <li>Crucially, it returns <code>methods</code> (the main object containing all chainable methods), <strong>not</strong> the promise. This is what allows the next method in the sequence to be called.</li>
</ol>
<p>The closure is essential for managing the single, evolving promise chain across all method calls.</p>

  "closures-memoize-with-custom-resolver": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A standard memoization function often uses \`JSON.stringify(args)\` to create a cache key. This fails for arguments that don't serialize well (like functions or complex objects). This problem involves creating a more flexible memoization function that lets the user provide their own "resolver" function to generate the cache key.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`memoize\` HOF now accepts a second argument, \`resolver\`. The closure holds the \`cache\` object. The returned function, when called, doesn't create the key itself. Instead, it calls the \`resolver\` function with its arguments to get the cache key. This decouples the memoization logic from the key-generation logic. For example, if memoizing a function that takes a user object, the resolver could simply be \`(user) => user.id\`.

  "closures-closures-in-webgl-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
WebGL is a low-level API for 2D and 3D graphics rendering. The process involves a lot of setup: creating buffers for geometry, compiling shader programs, and getting "locations" (pointers) to variables within those shaders. This setup is done once. The rendering happens in a loop (usually with \`requestAnimationFrame\`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The render loop function is a closure. It needs to access all the resources that were created during the setup phase (the buffer objects, the shader program, the uniform locations). The closure over the setup scope keeps all these GPU resource handles alive and accessible, so the render loop can efficiently send new data (like an updated camera position) to the GPU each frame without having to look up the resource locations again.

  "closures-timed-retry": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is an advanced and practical async pattern. When an operation fails (e.g., a network request), you often want to retry it. Instead of retrying immediately, it's better to wait a bit. Exponential backoff means you wait progressively longer between each retry (e.g., 20ms, 40ms, 80ms) to give a failing service time to recover.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`retry\` function would use a loop. Inside the loop is a \`try...catch\` block. The \`try\` block \`await\`s the async function. If it succeeds, the function returns. If it fails, the \`catch\` block checks if it has retries left. If so, it calculates the delay using an exponential formula (\`delay * 2 ** attemptNumber\`) and \`await\`s a delay promise. The closure is over the attempt number variable that is incremented in each loop.

  "closures-function-overloading": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
JavaScript does not support traditional function overloading (defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types). However, you can simulate it by having a single function that inspects its arguments (\`typeof\`, \`arguments.length\`) and decides which internal implementation to call.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An IIFE is used to create a closure. Inside the closure, the different implementations (\`greetByName\`, \`greetDefault\`) are defined as private functions. The IIFE returns a single public function. This public function acts as a dispatcher. It checks the number and types of the arguments it received and then calls the appropriate private function from its closure.

Closures are essential for managing this graph. For example, you might have a function that creates a synthesizer. Inside that function, you create the oscillator and gain nodes and store them in local variables. You would then return an object with methods like \`play(frequency)\` and \`setVolume(level)\`.

This is an advanced problem to solidify the difference between \`this\` and lexical scope. The key is to trace how \`this\` is determined for each function type.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
- \`obj.method1()\` is called. Inside \`method1\`, \`this\` is \`obj\`.
- \`method1\` defines an arrow function, \`method2\`.

<h3>‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough</h3>
<p>The <code>createStore</code> factory uses a closure to maintain two private state variables: the main <code>state</code> and a <code>pendingState</code> (which is <code>null</code> when no transaction is active).</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><code>begin()</code></strong>: Starts a transaction by making a shallow copy of the current <code>state</code> into <code>pendingState</code>.</li>
    <li><strong><code>update()</code></strong>: If a transaction is active, it modifies the <code>pendingState</code> object. The main <code>state</code> is not touched.</li>
    <li><strong><code>commit()</code></strong>: Replaces the main <code>state</code> with the <code>pendingState</code> and resets <code>pendingState</code> back to <code>null</code>, making the changes permanent.</li>
    <li><strong><code>rollback()</code></strong>: Simply resets <code>pendingState</code> to <code>null</code>, discarding all the temporary changes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The closure is essential for managing these different states privately and ensuring the main state is only modified in a controlled, transactional way.</p>

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a highly advanced conceptual problem. To understand how a Promise works under the hood, you can see how closures are the fundamental building block.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simplified Promise class would have private variables in its closure (or constructor scope) for its \`state\` ('pending', 'fulfilled', 'rejected'), its final \`value\`, and an array of \`onFulfilled\` callbacks.
- The \`resolve\` function passed to the executor is a closure that can change the private \`state\` and \`value\`, and then execute any callbacks in the queue.
- The \`.then(callback)\` method is a closure that can access the callback queue and push the new \`callback\` into it.
The closures are what connect the external \`.then\` calls to the internal settlement logic.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Promise Internals**: Understanding the mechanics of asynchronous operations.

  "closures-private-static-members-simulation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Before ES2022 introduced native private static fields (\`static #myField\`), this behavior had to be simulated. The goal is to have a "static" variable that is associated with a constructor function/class but is private to it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The pattern uses an IIFE to create a private scope.
1. A \`privateStatic\` variable is declared inside the IIFE.
2. The \`Constructor\` function is defined inside the IIFE.
3. A static-like method, \`Constructor.getStatic\`, is defined. This method is a closure that has access to the \`privateStatic\` variable.
4. The IIFE returns the \`Constructor\`.
The result is that only the methods defined inside the IIFE (like \`getStatic\`) can access the \`privateStatic\` variable.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **IIFE**: Used to create a private, module-like scope.
- **Static Properties**: Properties that belong to the constructor/class itself, not to instances.

  "closures-performance-of-closures-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual discussion about the performance trade-offs of using closures.
- **Memory**: A closure prevents its lexical environment from being garbage collected. If the closed-over variables are large, this can increase memory consumption compared to a stateless function.
- **CPU**: Resolving a variable requires traversing the scope chain. Accessing a variable in a closure (one level up) is theoretically slower than accessing a local variable.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
In practice, these costs are negligible in almost all situations. Modern JavaScript engines are incredibly optimized. The scope chain lookup is extremely fast, and the memory overhead is usually small. The benefits of encapsulation, readability, and powerful patterns that closures provide far outweigh the micro-optimization of trying to avoid them. You should only worry about this if a memory profiler explicitly points to a specific closure retaining a huge amount of data as a problem.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Performance Optimization**: Understanding where real-world bottlenecks occur.
- **Micro-optimizations**: Small optimizations that rarely have a meaningful impact on overall application performance.

  "closures-declarative-event-listener": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This pattern is very common in modern UI frameworks like React (with the \`useEffect\` hook). The idea is to have a function that sets up a side effect (like an event listener) and declaratively returns another function that knows how to clean up that specific effect.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`withEventListener\` function takes the element, event name, and the handler.
1. It calls \`element.addEventListener(event, handler)\`.
2. It then returns a new function, \`cleanup\`.
3. This \`cleanup\` function is a closure. It "remembers" the specific \`element\`, \`event\`, and \`handler\` it was created with.
4. When \`cleanup()\` is called, it uses these captured variables to perfectly remove the exact listener it added: \`element.removeEventListener(event, handler)\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Declarative Programming**: Describing the setup and cleanup logic in one place.
- **Side Effects**: Interactions with systems outside of a function's local scope (like the DOM).

  "closures-ultimate-challenge-redux-store": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This challenge involves building a miniature version of a Redux store, which is a perfect and powerful example of closures in action. A Redux store encapsulates your entire application state and provides a strict, predictable way to interact with it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`createStore\` function is a factory that uses a closure to hold the three most important private pieces of the store:
1.  **\`state\`**: The current state of the application.
2.  **\`reducer\`**: The function that knows how to calculate the next state.
3.  **\`listeners\`**: An array of callback functions to be called when the state changes.

It returns an object with public methods that are all closures:
- **\`getState()\`**: A closure that can read the private \`state\`.
- **\`dispatch(action)\`**: A closure that calls the private \`reducer\` to get the new state, updates the private \`state\`, and then calls all the private \`listeners\`.
- **\`subscribe(listener)\`**: A closure that can push a new function into the private \`listeners\` array.

This architecture completely encapsulates the store's logic and state, which is the foundation of Redux's predictability.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **State Management**: The core challenge solved by libraries like Redux.
- **Encapsulation**: Closures provide the mechanism for keeping the store's state private and safe.
- **Observer Pattern**: The subscribe/dispatch mechanism is a form of the Observer (or Pub/Sub) pattern.
