  "settimeout-callback": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a foundational asynchronous operation in JavaScript. The goal is to execute a piece of code, but not immediately‚Äîonly after a specified amount of time has passed. This illustrates the non-blocking nature of JavaScript and introduces the concept of a "macrotask."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`setTimeout\` function is used to schedule the execution of a callback function.
\`\`\`javascript
function delayedExecution(delay) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // This code runs after the delay
    console.log(\`Executed after \${delay}ms\`);
  }, delay);
}
\`\`\`
1. **\`setTimeout(callback, delay)\`**: This Web API schedules the \`callback\` function to be added to the macrotask queue after the \`delay\` (in milliseconds) has passed.<grok-card data-id="deba04" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **Non-blocking**: The JavaScript engine does *not* wait. It sets the timer and immediately continues executing any code that comes after the \`setTimeout\` call.<grok-card data-id="c2630f" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
3. **Event Loop**: After the main script has finished and the call stack is empty, the event loop will pick up tasks from the queue. Once the timer expires, the callback is moved from the Web API environment to the macrotask queue, ready to be executed.<grok-card data-id="e64a0b" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Actions that don't complete immediately. JavaScript doesn't block and wait for them.
- **Callback Function**: A function passed as an argument to another function, to be "called back" at a later time.
- **Event Loop & Macrotask Queue**: The core mechanism in JavaScript runtimes that handles asynchronous tasks. \`setTimeout\`, \`setInterval\`, and I/O operations are macrotasks.<grok-card data-id="ba6d82" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
`,
  "promise-creation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A \`Promise\` is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. This problem is about creating a basic promise that successfully completes or "resolves."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`Promise\` constructor takes a function (the "executor") which is given two arguments: a \`resolve\` function and a \`reject\` function. We call \`resolve\` to signal a successful completion.
\`\`\`javascript
const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Simulate an async operation like a network request
  setTimeout(() => {
    // If successful, call resolve with the result
    resolve("Operation was successful!");
  }, 500);
});

// To get the value, we use .then()
myPromise.then(result => {
  console.log(result); // "Operation was successful!"
});
\`\`\`
1. **Executor Function**: \`(resolve, reject) => { ... }\` runs immediately when the promise is created.<grok-card data-id="685a9c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **\`resolve(value)\`**: This function is called to change the promise's state from "pending" to "fulfilled". The \`value\` is passed to any \`.then()\` handlers.<grok-card data-id="cfa195" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
3. **\`.then(handler)\`**: This method is used to schedule a callback to be executed when the promise is fulfilled.<grok-card data-id="5188c0" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Promise**: An object representing a future value. It can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.<grok-card data-id="1e38b9" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

`,
  "promise-rejection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the other side of a Promise: handling failure. If an asynchronous operation fails, the promise should be "rejected". This rejection needs to be handled to prevent "unhandled promise rejection" errors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Inside the promise executor, the \`reject\` function is called to signal an error. This is handled by a \`.catch()\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
const failingPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // If an error occurs, call reject with a reason
    reject(new Error("Operation failed!"));
  }, 500);
});

failingPromise
  .then(result => { /* This part is skipped */ })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error.message); // "Operation failed!"
  });
\`\`\`
1. **\`reject(reason)\`**: This function is called to change the promise's state from "pending" to "rejected". The \`reason\` (usually an \`Error\` object) is passed to any \`.catch()\` handlers.<grok-card data-id="dd8e26" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **\`.catch(handler)\`**: This method schedules a callback to be executed if the promise is rejected.<grok-card data-id="60c59d" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "fetch-api-data": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`fetch\` API is the modern, promise-based way to make network requests in the browser. The task is to use \`fetch\` to retrieve data from a public API and display it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`fetch()\` function is called with a URL. It returns a promise that resolves to a \`Response\` object. We then need to call another method on the response object, like \`.json()\`, to parse the body of the response.
\`\`\`javascript
fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1')
  .then(response => {
    // The first .then gets the Response object. We need to parse its body.
    return response.json(); // .json() also returns a promise
  })
  .then(data => {
    // The second .then gets the parsed JSON data.
    console.log(data.title); // "delectus aut autem"
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error("Fetch failed:", error);

  "async-await-syntax": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`async/await\` is modern (ES2017) syntax built on top of Promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and feels synchronous, which is often easier to read, write, and debug than long \`.then()\` chains.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An \`async\` function is created. The \`await\` keyword is used to "pause" the function's execution until a promise settles, and then get its resolved value.
\`\`\`javascript
async function fetchTodo() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1');
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data.title);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Fetch failed:", error);

1. **\`async function\`**: The \`async\` keyword makes a function return a promise implicitly.<grok-card data-id="53ca9c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **\`await\`**: The \`await\` keyword can only be used inside an \`async\` function. It pauses execution, waits for the promise on its right to resolve, and then resumes with the resolved value.<grok-card data-id="ef8eb3" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
3. **Error Handling**: With \`async/await\`, you can use standard synchronous \`try...catch\` blocks for error handling.<grok-card data-id="d44bc4" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "promise-chaining": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`.then()\` method of a Promise always returns a *new* promise. This is what allows you to chain them. You can perform a sequence of asynchronous or synchronous steps, where each step depends on the result of the previous one.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A sequence of \`.then()\` calls is used to transform a value step-by-step.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve(10)
  .then(value => {
    console.log(value); // 10
    // The returned value is wrapped in a new promise that resolves to 20
    return value * 2; 
  })
  .then(value => {
    console.log(value); // 20
    return value + 5;   
  })
  .then(finalValue => {
    console.log('Final:', finalValue); // 25
  });
\`\`\`
1. **Passing Values**: The resolved value of one promise is passed as the argument to the next \`.then()\` handler in the chain.<grok-card data-id="c0dbf0" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **Returning Promises**: You can also return another promise from a \`.then()\` handler, and the chain will wait for that new promise to resolve before continuing.<grok-card data-id="9c1e4c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "async-await-error-handling": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A key advantage of \`async/await\` is that it allows you to handle errors from asynchronous operations using standard, synchronous \`try...catch\` blocks. This is often cleaner and more intuitive than chaining \`.catch()\` methods.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A rejecting promise is awaited inside a \`try\` block. The rejection is caught by the \`catch\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
async function testError() {
  try {
    const result = await Promise.reject(new Error('Oops!'));
    console.log(result); // This line is never reached
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Caught the error:', error.message); // "Caught: Oops!"
  }
}
testError();
\`\`\`
1. **\`await\` Rejection**: When you \`await\` a promise that rejects, it throws an exception at that line.<grok-card data-id="5bf077" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **\`try...catch\`**: This exception is then caught by the surrounding \`try...catch\` block, just like a synchronous error.<grok-card data-id="e4b251" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "promise-all": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Promise.all()\` is a static method that takes an array of promises. It returns a single new promise that fulfills when *all* of the input promises have fulfilled. The resolved value is an array of the results from the input promises, in the same order.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two promises are created, and \`Promise.all()\` is used to wait for both to complete.
\`\`\`javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve("First");
const p2 = new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Second"), 100));

Promise.all([p1, p2]).then(values => {
  // values is ["First", "Second"]

  "promise-all-rejection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An important behavior of \`Promise.all()\` is that it is "fail-fast." If *any* of the input promises reject, the main \`Promise.all()\` promise immediately rejects with the reason of that first promise that rejected. It does not wait for the other promises to finish.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
One promise in the array rejects, causing the entire \`Promise.all\` to reject.
\`\`\`javascript
const p1 = Promise.resolve("Success");
const p2 = Promise.reject("Failure");

Promise.all([p1, p2])
  .then(values => {

  "promise-race": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Promise.race()\` is a static method that takes an array of promises. It returns a new promise that settles (either fulfills or rejects) as soon as the *first* promise in the array settles.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two promises with different delays are passed to \`Promise.race()\`. The faster one "wins".
\`\`\`javascript
const p1 = new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("one"), 500));
const p2 = new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("two"), 100));

Promise.race([p1, p2]).then(result => {
  console.log(result); // "two"

  "event-loop-macrotask-microtask": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a core conceptual problem about the JavaScript Event Loop. The Event Loop has different queues for different types of asynchronous tasks. The two main queues are the **Macrotask Queue** (or just "task queue") and the **Microtask Queue**. The key rule is: after each macrotask, the event loop runs *all* tasks in the microtask queue to completion before starting the next macrotask.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The execution order of \`setTimeout\` (macrotask) and a Promise's \`.then\` (microtask) is observed.
\`\`\`javascript
console.log('Start');

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log('Timeout (Macrotask)');
}, 0);

Promise.resolve().then(() => {
  console.log('Promise (Microtask)');
});

console.log('End');
\`\`\`

  "callback-hell-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
"Callback hell" (or the "pyramid of doom") is an anti-pattern that arises from deeply nested asynchronous callbacks. As each async operation depends on the one before it, the code becomes increasingly indented, making it extremely difficult to read, reason about, and handle errors in.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of nested callbacks for sequential operations.

  "promisify-callback-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
"Promisification" is the process of converting a function that takes a classic "error-first" callback into a function that returns a promise. This allows you to use older, callback-based APIs with modern promise-based syntax like \`.then()\` or \`async/await\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A wrapper function is created that returns a \`new Promise\`. The original callback function is called inside the promise's executor.

  "async-await-sequential": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A common requirement in asynchronous programming is to perform a series of operations in a specific order, where each operation must wait for the previous one to complete. \`async/await\` makes this incredibly simple and readable.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
A common pitfall with the \`fetch\` API is that it only rejects its promise on a network failure (e.g., DNS error, no internet connection). It does **not** reject on HTTP error statuses like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error). You must check for these manually.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`response.ok\` property is checked to determine if the request was successful.
\`\`\`javascript
async function checkStatus(url) {

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem that delves deeper into the event loop. When a promise resolves, its \`.then()\` callbacks are added to the microtask queue. The event loop will always execute *all* tasks currently in the microtask queue before moving on to the next macrotask. Microtasks themselves are also executed in the order they were queued.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Multiple \`.then()\` handlers are attached to the same resolved promise.
\`\`\`javascript
const p = Promise.resolve();

p.then(() => console.log('Microtask 1'));
p.then(() => console.log('Microtask 2'));

The event loop works because tasks (both macro and micro) are generally short. If a task takes too long, it "starves" the event loop, preventing other tasks from running. This can freeze a web page's UI or make a server unresponsive.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two conceptual examples are shown.

  "promise-race-rejection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the behavior of \`Promise.race()\` when one of the promises rejects. The \`Promise.race()\` promise will settle as soon as the first input promise settles, and it will adopt that promise's outcome. If the first one to finish is a rejection, \`Promise.race()\` will reject.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A fast-rejecting promise "wins" the race.
\`\`\`javascript
const p1 = new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Success"), 200));
const p2 = new Promise((_, rej) => setTimeout(() => rej("Failure"), 100));

Promise.race([p1, p2])

  "async-await-in-map": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a very common pitfall. The \`.map()\` array method is not "promise-aware." If you pass an \`async\` function to \`.map()\`, it will start all the async operations, but it will **not** wait for them to complete. It will immediately return an array of pending Promises.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The incorrect and correct ways are shown.
\`\`\`javascript
const ids = [1, 2, 3];

// INCORRECT: This does not wait
const promises = ids.map(async (id) => {
  return await fetchData(id);
});
// 'promises' is [Promise, Promise, Promise]

// CORRECT: Wrap with Promise.all
async function processArray() {
  const promises = ids.map(id => fetchData(id));
  const results = await Promise.all(promises);
  return results;
}
\`\`\`
1. **The Pitfall**: \`.map()\` is synchronous and doesn't know about \`await\`. It calls the \`async\` function for each item and moves on.<grok-card data-id="863bb6" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
2. **The Solution**: First, use \`.map()\` to create an array of promises (starting all the operations concurrently), and then use \`await Promise.all()\` to wait for them all to finish.<grok-card data-id="01bee2" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "promise-any-rejection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Promise.any()\` rejects only when *all* of its input promises have rejected. When it does, it rejects with a special \`AggregateError\` object. This error object has an \`.errors\` property which is an array containing all the individual rejection reasons.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two promises are rejected, and the resulting \`AggregateError\` is caught.
\`\`\`javascript
const p1 = Promise.reject("Error 1");
const p2 = Promise.reject("Error 2");

Promise.any([p1, p2])
  .then(val => console.log(val)) // Not called

  "promise-chain-error-handling": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
One of the powerful features of promise chains is that a single \`.catch()\` at the end of the chain can handle a rejection from *any* of the preceding \`.then()\` blocks. When a promise in the chain rejects, the execution immediately jumps to the next available \`.catch()\` handler, skipping any intermediate \`.then()\` handlers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown in the first \`.then()\`, skipping the second \`.then()\` and being caught by the final \`.catch()\`.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("Step 1");
    throw new Error("Failure in chain");

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem to understand how promise combinators can be built. You could implement \`Promise.race\` by creating a new promise. Then, iterate over the input promises and attach both a \`resolve\` and a \`reject\` handler to each one. The first handler to be called will settle the new, outer promise.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual implementation.

  "awaiting-non-promise": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`await\` keyword is designed to work with promises. However, if you \`await\` a value that is not a promise (a "non-thenable"), JavaScript will treat it as if it were an immediately resolved promise with that value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`await\` keyword is used on a number.
\`\`\`javascript
async function test() {
  const result = await 42;
  console.log(result); // 42

  "async-iteration-protocol-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the asynchronous version of the iterator protocol. An object is an **async iterable** if it has a method with the key \`Symbol.asyncIterator\`. This method must return an **async iterator** object. The async iterator must have a \`.next()\` method that returns a **Promise** which resolves to the standard \`{ value, done }\` object.

  "promise-chain-vs-nested-then": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This illustrates a common mistake. A proper promise chain is flat. Incorrectly nesting a \`.then()\` call inside another \`.then()\` handler without returning the inner promise creates a "pyramid" structure and breaks the clean flow and error handling of the chain.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A comparison of the correct and incorrect patterns.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`mode\` option in the \`fetch\` API's options object controls how it handles cross-origin requests, which are subject to the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy.
- **\`cors\`** (default): The standard mode. It respects CORS headers from the server. If the server doesn't permit the request, it will fail.
- **\`no-cors\`**: Allows you to make a cross-origin request to a server that doesn't support CORS, but you get back an "opaque" response. You cannot read the status or body of the response. This is useful for things like firing off a request to a logging service where you don't care about the response.

  "async-batching-requests": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual performance optimization pattern. If you have a function that might be called many times in quick succession (e.g., logging an event for every click), it can be inefficient to send a network request for each call. Batching involves collecting these calls into a queue and sending them all in a single network request after a short delay.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The logic combines a queue with a debounced function.
1. Create a queue array (e.g., \`let requestQueue = [];\`).
2. The public function that users call simply pushes its arguments into the \`requestQueue\`.
3. Have a separate "debounced" function that:
    - Checks if the queue is empty. If so, does nothing.

  "macrotask-rendering-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about how the event loop interacts with browser rendering. The browser's rendering pipeline (style, layout, paint) is typically scheduled as a macrotask. This means that after one macrotask (like a \`click\` handler) finishes, the browser will first empty the entire microtask queue, and *then* it will perform any necessary rendering updates, and *then* it will pick the next macrotask from the queue.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This explains why a loop of microtasks can block rendering.
\`\`\`javascript
// This will freeze the page and the update will never be seen
element.textContent = "Updating...";
function microtaskLoop() {
  Promise.resolve().then(microtaskLoop);

  "async-await-vs-generators": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the history and implementation of async/await. Before \`async/await\` was introduced, developers used libraries that combined generators and promises to achieve a similar synchronous-looking control flow. \`async/await\` is essentially syntactic sugar over this pattern.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. An \`async\` function can be thought of as a **generator** that only \`yield\`s promises.
2. The \`await\` keyword is like \`yield\`.
3. A "coroutine" or "runner" function takes the generator's iterator. It calls \`.next()\`. When it gets a yielded promise, it waits for that promise to resolve, and then calls \`.next()\` again, passing the resolved value back into the generator.

  "promise-chain-flattening": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A key feature of promise chains is that they automatically "unwrap" or "flatten" promises returned from a \`.then()\` handler. If you return a new promise, the chain doesn't resolve with that promise object itself; instead, the chain "unwraps" \`p2\`, waits for it to settle, and then adopts its final state and value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`.then()\` handler returns another promise.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => {
    console.log("First step");
    return new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Inner promise resolved"), 200));

  "event-loop-node-vs-browser": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
While the core concept is the same (a loop that processes tasks from a queue), the event loops in Node.js and browsers have different implementations.
- **Browser Event Loop**: Simpler. It has one macrotask queue and one microtask queue. It takes one macrotask, runs it, then empties the entire microtask queue, then renders (if needed), then repeats.
- **Node.js Event Loop**: More complex and structured into distinct **phases**. A single loop "tick" goes through these phases:
  1. **Timers**: Executes \`setTimeout\` and \`setInterval\` callbacks.
  2. **Pending Callbacks**: Executes I/O callbacks deferred to the next loop iteration.
  3. **Idle, Prepare**: Internal use only.
  4. **Poll**: Retrieve new I/O events; execute their callbacks.
  5. **Check**: Executes \`setImmediate\` callbacks.
  6. **Close Callbacks**: Executes close event callbacks (e.g., \`socket.on('close', ...)\`).

Microtasks (from \`process.nextTick\` and Promises) are executed *between* these phases.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
A crucial rule of Promises is that \`.then()\` callbacks are *always* executed asynchronously in the microtask queue, even if the promise is already resolved. This ensures a consistent and predictable execution order.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`.then()\` is attached to an already resolved promise.
\`\`\`javascript
console.log('A');
Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('C'));
console.log('B');

// Output: A, B, C

  "promise-chain-return-value": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A promise chain is itself a promise. The final state and value of that chain are determined by the last handler in the chain.

- If the last handler is a \`.catch()\` and it returns a value, the chain **resolves** with that value (effectively "handling" the error).
- If a handler throws an error or returns a rejected promise, the chain rejects.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`.catch()\` block handles an error and returns a default value, causing the final promise to resolve.

  "what-is-a-macrotask-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a core concept of the event loop. A **macrotask** (also called a "task") represents a distinct, self-contained piece of work that the JavaScript engine needs to do. The event loop picks one macrotask from its queue in each "tick."

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Common examples of macrotasks include:
- Executing the main script itself.
- A callback for \`setTimeout\` or \`setInterval\`.
- A callback for a user event, like a \`click\` or \`keydown\`.
- I/O operations in Node.js.
- The browser's rendering cycle (style, layout, paint).

After one macrotask completes, the engine will run all available microtasks before starting the next macrotask.<grok-card data-id="2c274c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "what-is-a-microtask-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A **microtask** is a short function that needs to run immediately after the currently executing script finishes, but before the browser has a chance to do other things like rendering or running the next macrotask. They have a higher priority than macrotasks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Common examples of microtasks include:
- A callback for a promise's \`.then()\`, \`.catch()\`, or \`.finally()\`.
- Callbacks for \`MutationObserver\`.
- Functions queued with \`queueMicrotask()\`.
- Callbacks for \`process.nextTick()\` in Node.js (which has even higher priority than other microtasks).

The entire microtask queue is always emptied after each macrotask completes.<grok-card data-id="d2c959" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>

  "queuemicrotask-api": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`queueMicrotask()\` global function provides a standard way to queue a function to be executed as a microtask. This is useful when you want to ensure a piece of code runs asynchronously but before the next macrotask (like \`setTimeout\`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The execution order is compared with \`setTimeout\`.
\`\`\`javascript
console.log('Sync 1');

setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout (Macro)'), 0);
queueMicrotask(() => console.log('Microtask'));

console.log('Sync 2');

// Output: Sync 1, Sync 2, Microtask, Timeout (Macro)

  "promise-unwrapping-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a key feature of promise chains that prevents nesting. If you return a promise (\`p2\`) from inside a \`.then()\` handler, the chain doesn't simply resolve with the \`p2\` promise object. Instead, the chain "unwraps" \`p2\`, waits for it to settle, and then adopts its final state and value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`.then()\` handler returns another promise.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => {
    return new Promise(res => setTimeout(() => res("Inner resolved"), 200));
  })
  .then(result => {
    // 'result' is the *resolved value* of the inner promise ("Inner resolved"),
    // not the promise object itself.
    console.log(result);
  });

  "async-pool-pattern-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An async pool (or concurrency limiter) is a pattern used to process a large number of asynchronous tasks while limiting the number of tasks that run concurrently. This is crucial for avoiding rate limits on an API or overwhelming a system with too many open connections.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual implementation.
1. You have a list of all tasks to be run.
2. You have a pool of "workers," which is a small array (e.g., of size 5).
3. Start the first 5 tasks from the list.
4. Each time a task completes, it picks the next available task from the main list and starts it.
5. This can be managed using \`Promise.all()\` on the worker pool or with more complex promise chain logic to ensure a worker always has a task if one is available.<grok-card data-id="8a644c" data-type="citation_card"></grok-card>
