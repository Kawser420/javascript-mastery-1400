`,

  // problem explanation--> 09
  "prefix-vs-postfix-increment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights the important difference between the prefix and postfix versions of the increment operator when they are used within a larger expression.
- **Prefix (\`++x\`)**: The variable is incremented *first*, and the expression evaluates to the *new* value.
- **Postfix (\`x++\`)**: The expression evaluates to the *original* value of the variable, and *then* the variable is incremented.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The two versions are compared.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 10;
let y = 10;

const prefixResult = ++x; // x becomes 11, prefixResult is 11
const postfixResult = y++; // postfixResult is 10, then y becomes 11

\`\`\`javascript
'Hello' + ' World'; // "Hello World"
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Operator Overloading**: The ability of an operator to have different implementations depending on the types of its operands.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 15
  "type-coercion-add-string-number": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates the type coercion rule for the \`+\` operator. If one operand is a string and the other is a number, the number will be converted to a string, and then the two strings will be concatenated.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A string and a number are combined.
\`\`\`javascript
'Score: ' + 100; // The number 100 is converted to the string "100"
                  // The result is "Score: 100"

  "chained-assignment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The assignment operator is right-associative, which means you can chain assignments together to assign the same value to multiple variables in one line.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The expression \`c = "Assigned"\` is evaluated first. It assigns the string to \`c\` and the expression itself evaluates to the assigned value ("Assigned"). This value is then assigned to \`b\`, and so on.
\`\`\`javascript
let a, b, c;
a = b = c = "Assigned";
// a, b, and c are all "Assigned"

  // problem explanation--> 25
  "assignment-in-expression": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A key concept in JavaScript is that an assignment (\`x = 5\`) is an expression, not just a statement. This means it evaluates to a value—specifically, the value that was assigned.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An assignment is performed inside the initialization of another variable.
\`\`\`javascript
let x;
const y = (x = 5);
// 1. The expression (x = 5) assigns 5 to x.
// 2. The expression (x = 5) evaluates to 5.

  "strict-equality": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The strict equality operator (\`===\`) is the recommended way to compare two values in JavaScript. It returns \`true\` only if the operands are equal and of the **same type**. It does not perform type coercion.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 === "5"; // false
\`\`\`
Even though the values look the same, their types (\`number\` and \`string\`) are different, so the result is \`false\`.

- **Type Coercion**: The automatic conversion of values between types, which strict equality avoids.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 27
  "loose-equality": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The loose equality operator (\`==\`) compares two values for equality *after* attempting to convert them to a common type. This is called type coercion. Its behavior can sometimes be unpredictable, so \`===\` is generally preferred.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 == "5"; // true
\`\`\`
Before comparing, JavaScript coerces the string \`"5"\` into the number \`5\`. Since \`5\` is equal to \`5\`, the result is \`true\`.

  "strict-inequality": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The strict inequality operator (\`!==\`) is the logical opposite of the strict equality operator. It returns \`true\` if the operands are not equal or are not of the same type. It does not perform type coercion.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 !== "5"; // true
\`\`\`
Because their types are different, they are not strictly equal, so the strict inequality operator returns \`true\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Strict Inequality (!==)**: The recommended way to check if two values are not equal.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 29
  "loose-inequality": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A number is compared to a string.
\`\`\`javascript
5 != "5"; // false
\`\`\`
Before comparing, JavaScript coerces the string \`"5"\` into the number \`5\`. Since \`5\` is equal to \`5\`, the inequality check returns \`false\`.

The logical AND operator (\`&&\`) exhibits "short-circuiting" behavior. If the first operand evaluates to a falsy value, the operator immediately returns that falsy value without ever evaluating the second operand.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function call is placed as the second operand.
\`\`\`javascript
let secondOperandEvaluated = false;
function func() {
  secondOperandEvaluated = true;
  return true;
}

false && func(); // The call to func() never happens.
\`\`\`
This is a very useful feature for performance and for creating "guards" (e.g., \`user && user.name\`).

  "logical-or-for-defaults": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A common and historic pattern in JavaScript is to use the short-circuiting behavior of the logical OR operator (\`||\`) to provide a default value for a variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The OR operator provides a default for an empty string.
\`\`\`javascript
const name = '';
const displayName = name || 'Guest'; // displayName is 'Guest'
\`\`\`
Because the \`name\` variable is an empty string (which is falsy), the expression evaluates to the second operand, "Guest". A potential pitfall is that this pattern will also override other intentional falsy values like \`0\` or \`false\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is applied to a value.
\`\`\`javascript
!!'hello'; // true
!!0;       // false
!!{};      // true
\`\`\`
1.  The first \`!\` coerces the value to a boolean and inverts it (\`!'hello'\` -> \`false\`).
2.  The second \`!\` inverts it back to its original boolean value (\`!false\` -> \`true\`).

  "bitwise-flags-conceptual": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a classic programming technique. Bitwise flags allow you to store multiple boolean states (on/off) in a single integer. This is done by assigning each flag a value that is a power of two (1, 2, 4, 8, ...), which corresponds to a single bit being "on" in the binary representation.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Flags are defined and combined.
\`\`\`javascript
const READ = 4;    // 0100
const WRITE = 2;   // 0010
const EXECUTE = 1; // 0001

// Give a user READ and EXECUTE permissions
let userPermissions = READ | EXECUTE; // 0100 | 0001 = 0101 (which is 5)
\`\`\`
Bitwise OR (\`|\`) is used to combine flags. This is very memory-efficient.

  "bitwise-check-flag": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
To check if a specific flag is "on" in a permissions variable, you can use the bitwise AND operator (\`&\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A user's permissions are checked for the READ flag.
\`\`\`javascript
const READ = 4; // 0100
let permissions = 5; // 0101 (READ and EXECUTE)

// The & operator will be non-zero only if the READ bit is set
if ((permissions & READ) > 0) {
  // Has read permission
}
\`\`\`
\`0101 & 0100 = 0100\` (which is 4). Since 4 is greater than 0, the check passes.

  "bitwise-set-flag": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
To add a flag (turn a bit "on") to a permissions variable without affecting other flags, you can use the bitwise OR assignment operator (\`|=\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The WRITE permission is added to a user.
\`\`\`javascript
const WRITE = 2; // 0010
let permissions = 5; // 0101

permissions |= WRITE; // 0101 | 0010 = 0111 (which is 7)

  "bitwise-clear-flag": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
To remove a flag (turn a bit "off") from a permissions variable without affecting other flags, you use a combination of bitwise NOT (\`~\`) and bitwise AND (\`&\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The EXECUTE permission is removed.
\`\`\`javascript
const EXECUTE = 1; // 0001
let permissions = 7; // 0111

// ~EXECUTE creates a mask with the EXECUTE bit off: ...11111110
permissions &= ~EXECUTE; // 0111 & ...1110 = 0110 (which is 6)

The WRITE permission is toggled twice.
\`\`\`javascript
const WRITE = 2; // 0010
let permissions = 5; // 0101

permissions ^= WRITE; // 0101 ^ 0010 = 0111 (7). The flag is now on.

  "fast-floor-with-double-not": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a classic bitwise "trick". The double bitwise NOT operator (\`~~\`) can be used as a very fast way to truncate a decimal part of a number, effectively acting like \`Math.floor()\` for positive numbers and \`Math.ceil()\` for negative numbers.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is applied to a decimal.
\`\`\`javascript
~~5.95;  // 5
~~-5.95; // -5
\`\`\`
This works because the first \`~\` converts the number to a 32-bit integer (truncating the decimal) and inverts the bits. The second \`~\` inverts the bits back, leaving just the truncated integer.

The \`in\` operator is used to check for the \`toString\` method on a plain object.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {};
'toString' in obj; // true

  "type-coercion-subtract-string": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows how type coercion differs for the subtraction operator versus the addition operator. While \`+\` performs concatenation if one operand is a string, other arithmetic operators like \`-\` will always attempt to convert both operands to numbers first.

  "assignment-in-condition": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a very common bug, especially for beginners. Using the assignment operator (\`=\`) inside a conditional (like an \`if\` statement) instead of an equality operator (\`===\` or \`==\`) is valid syntax, but usually not what is intended.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The assignment expression \`x = 0\` is evaluated.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 1;
if (x = 0) {
  // This block is skipped
}
// After the if statement, x is now 0.
\`\`\`
1.  The expression \`(x = 0)\` assigns 0 to \`x\`.
2.  The expression itself evaluates to the assigned value, which is 0.

A mask for READ and WRITE permissions is created and checked.
\`\`\`javascript
const READ = 4;    // 0100
const WRITE = 2;   // 0010
const EXECUTE = 1; // 0001

  "relational-comparison-of-objects": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a strange corner of JavaScript's type coercion. When objects are compared using relational operators (\`<\`, \`>\`), JavaScript attempts to convert them to primitives to perform the comparison. It first tries calling the \`.valueOf()\` method, and if that doesn't return a primitive, it calls \`.toString()\`.

### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a practical application of bitwise operators. A 24-bit color value is often stored as a single integer, with 8 bits for red, 8 for green, and 8 for blue. Bitwise shifting and masking can be used to extract these individual channel values.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The channels of \`#FF00FF\` (magenta) are extracted.
\`\`\`javascript
const color = 0xFF00FF; // 16711935

// Shift the red channel all the way to the right

const noUser = null;

// The right side is only evaluated if the left side is truthy.
const name1 = user && user.profile && user.profile.name; // 'Frank'
const name2 = noUser && noUser.profile; // returns null, no error
\`\`\`
This pattern is still common, but modern JavaScript often uses the optional chaining operator (\`?.\`) for the same purpose, which is more concise.

  "instanceof-with-inheritance": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that the \`instanceof\` operator correctly traverses the prototype chain. An object is considered an instance of its own class, its parent class, its grandparent class, and so on, all the way up to \`Object\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An instance of a \`Dog\` class is checked.
\`\`\`javascript
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}
const myDog = new Dog();

myDog instanceof Dog;    // true
myDog instanceof Animal; // true
\`\`\`
This works because the prototype of \`myDog\` is \`Dog.prototype\`, and the prototype of \`Dog.prototype\` is \`Animal.prototype\`.

  "infinity-type": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem confirms the data type of the special global value \`Infinity\`. Although it represents a concept, in JavaScript it is a value of the \`number\` type.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`typeof\` operator is used on the \`Infinity\` global property.
\`\`\`javascript
typeof Infinity; // "number"
\`\`\`
This allows \`Infinity\` to be used in numerical comparisons and calculations.

### 📚 Key Concepts

  "destructuring-assignment-with-assignment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates an advanced feature where you can combine a default value assignment with the destructuring pattern. This is particularly useful for extracting properties from objects that may be missing certain fields.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An object property \`x\` is destructured. If it's undefined in the source object, a default value of 10 is assigned to it.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = { y: 20 };
let { x = 10 } = obj;
// x is 10
// y is not defined in this scope
\`\`\`
The syntax elegantly handles missing data by providing a fallback value directly in the assignment.

  "void-operator-in-links": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a historical use of the \`void\` operator. In older HTML, to create a link that executed JavaScript but didn't navigate the page, developers would use the \`javascript:\` pseudo-protocol. However, if the script returned a value, the browser would replace the page with it. \`void(0)\` evaluates to \`undefined\` and prevents this navigation.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Conceptual HTML:
\`\`\`html
<!-- Clicking this link does nothing and doesn't navigate -->
<a href="javascript:void(0);">Do Nothing</a>
\`\`\`
In modern web development, this pattern is obsolete. Event listeners (\`addEventListener\`) are used instead to handle clicks without affecting the URL.

  "optional-chaining-and-nullish-coalescing": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a very common and powerful pattern in modern JavaScript that combines two ES2020 operators.
1. **Optional Chaining (\`?.\`)**: Safely access a nested property. If any part of the chain is \`null\` or \`undefined\`, it stops and returns \`undefined\`.
2. **Nullish Coalescing (\`??\`)**: Provide a default value if the result of an expression is \`null\` or \`undefined\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A default value is provided for a potentially missing nested property.
\`\`\`javascript
const user = { profile: null };

// Safely access user.profile.name, and if it's null/undefined, use 'Guest'
const name = user.profile?.name ?? 'Guest'; // name is 'Guest'
\`\`\`
This is a very robust and concise way to handle potentially missing data.

  "bitwise-xor-find-unique": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a clever trick using the bitwise XOR (\`^\`) operator. The XOR operator has the property that \`x ^ x = 0\` and \`x ^ 0 = x\`. If you XOR all numbers in an array where every number appears twice except for one, all the paired numbers will cancel each other out (\`n ^ n = 0\`), leaving only the unique number.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`reduce\` method is used to XOR all elements together.
\`\`\`javascript
const nums = [2, 3, 4, 3, 2];
const unique = nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc ^ val, 0);
// ((((0^2)^3)^4)^3)^2 = 4

  "spread-set-to-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The spread syntax (\`...\`) can be used on any iterable object. Since an ES6 \`Set\` is iterable, this provides a very simple and direct way to convert a \`Set\` into an \`Array\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`Set\` is spread into an array literal.
\`\`\`javascript
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
const arr = [...mySet]; // [1, 2, 3]

  "operator-precedence-assignment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about operator precedence. Assignment operators (\`=\`, \`+=\`, etc.) have a very low precedence. This means that in an expression like \`x = 5 + 3\`, the right side of the assignment is almost always fully evaluated before the assignment itself takes place.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The addition is performed before the assignment.
\`\`\`javascript
let x;
x = 5 + 3; // 5 + 3 is evaluated to 8 first. Then, 8 is assigned to x.

  "type-coercion-with-subtraction": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem contrasts the behavior of the addition operator (\`+\`) with other arithmetic operators like subtraction (\`-\`). While \`+\` will perform string concatenation if either operand is a string, the \`-\`, \`*\`, and \`/\` operators will always attempt to convert both operands to numbers before performing the operation.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Subtraction is performed on a numeric string.
\`\`\`javascript
"10" - 5; // The string "10" is coerced to the number 10. The result is 5.
\`\`\`
This makes the behavior of these operators more predictable for mathematical calculations.

  "delete-non-configurable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Object properties have internal attributes, one of which is \`configurable\`. If a property's \`configurable\` attribute is \`false\`, it cannot be deleted. The \`delete\` operator will fail (returning \`false\` in non-strict mode, and throwing a \`TypeError\` in strict mode).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`delete\` operator is used on a non-configurable property.
\`\`\`javascript
'use strict';
try {
  delete Object.prototype; // This property is non-configurable
} catch (e) {
  // A TypeError is thrown

  "typeof-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a well-known quirk of the \`typeof\` operator. Because arrays are a type of object, \`typeof\` returns \`"object"\` for an array. It does not distinguish them from plain objects.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The correct way to check for an array is shown.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = [];
typeof arr; // "object"

// The correct way to check if a value is an array:

  "prefix-vs-postfix-in-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem combines array indexing with the prefix and postfix increment operators to show how the order of operations affects the result.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
- **Postfix \`i++\`**: The original value of \`i\` is used for the array index, and *then* \`i\` is incremented.
- **Prefix \`++i\`**: \`i\` is incremented *first*, and then the new value is used for the array index.
\`\`\`javascript

  "string-comparison-case-sensitivity": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights that lexicographical string comparison is case-sensitive. In Unicode (and ASCII), all uppercase letters have character codes that are smaller than all lowercase letters.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The comparison \`"a" > "A"\` is evaluated.
\`\`\`javascript
"a" > "A"; // true
"z" > "A"; // true
\`\`\`
Because 'a' has a higher character code than 'A', the expression is true. This is why sorting an array of strings like \`['Zebra', 'apple']\` will place "Zebra" first.

  "assignment-vs-equality-pitfall": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a classic and very common coding bug. Using a single equals sign (\`=\`), which is the assignment operator, inside an \`if\` condition instead of an equality operator (\`===\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The expression \`x = 0\` is an assignment. It assigns \`0\` to \`x\`, and the expression itself evaluates to the assigned value, \`0\`. Since \`0\` is a falsy value, the \`if\` block is not executed.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 1;
if (x = 0) { // This assigns 0 to x and evaluates to 0 (falsy)

  "logical-not-on-non-booleans": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The logical NOT operator (\`!\`) can be used on any value, not just booleans. It first implicitly coerces the value to its boolean equivalent (based on whether it's truthy or falsy) and then inverts that boolean value.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is used on a truthy string and a falsy number.
\`\`\`javascript
!'hello'; // 'hello' is truthy -> true. !true -> false.

  "bitwise-and-for-truncation": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a bitwise trick. All bitwise operations in JavaScript are performed on 32-bit signed integers. When a larger number is used, it is first truncated to 32 bits. A bitwise AND with \`0xFFFFFFFF\` (all 32 bits set to 1) is a no-op for a 32-bit integer, but it forces this truncation on a larger number.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operation forces a 33-bit number to be truncated.
\`\`\`javascript
4294967297 & 0xFFFFFFFF; // 1
// 4294967297 in binary is 100000000000000000000000000000001 (33 bits)

  "conditional-operator-associativity": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about operator associativity. The conditional (ternary) operator (\`? :\`) is **right-associative**. This means a nested expression like \`a ? b : c ? d : e\` is grouped from the right.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The expression is parsed as if it had parentheses on the right.
\`\`\`javascript
// a ? b : c ? d : e
// is equivalent to:
// a ? b : (c ? d : e)

false ? 'b' : (true ? 'd' : 'e'); // evaluates to 'd'

  "delete-and-strict-mode": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a difference in behavior for the \`delete\` operator in strict mode. In non-strict mode, attempting to delete something that cannot be deleted (like a variable) will fail silently and return \`false\`. In **strict mode**, this same operation will throw a \`SyntaxError\` or \`TypeError\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example in strict mode.
\`\`\`javascript
'use strict';
let x = 1;
// delete x; // This line would throw a SyntaxError.

### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the versatility of the spread syntax (\`...\`). It can be used on **any iterable object**, not just arrays. This includes \`Set\`, \`Map\`, \`String\`, and others.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`Set\` is spread into an array literal.
\`\`\`javascript
const mySet = new Set(['a', 'b']);
const arr = [...mySet]; // ['a', 'b']

  // problem explanation--> 144
  "logical-and-assignment-pitfall": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a potential pitfall of the logical AND assignment operator (\`&&=\`). Because it only assigns when the left-hand side is truthy, it will not perform an assignment if the variable is a "falsy" value that you might want to update, such as \`0\` or an empty string \`""\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is used on a variable with the value \`0\`.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 0;
x &&= 10;
// 'x' is still 0, because 0 is falsy.

  // problem explanation--> 145
  "bitwise-integer-check": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a bitwise trick. Since bitwise operators only work on 32-bit integers, any non-integer part of a number is truncated. The XOR operator has the property that \`x ^ 0 = x\`. Therefore, \`n ^ 0 === n\` will only be true if \`n\` is an integer.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The trick is used on an integer and a float.
\`\`\`javascript
(12 ^ 0) === 12;      // true
(12.5 ^ 0) === 12.5; // false, because (12.5 ^ 0) is 12.

  "optional-chaining-and-assignment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem demonstrating a syntactic rule. The optional chaining operator (\`?.\`) is used for reading properties and cannot appear on the left-hand side of an assignment operation.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The invalid syntax is shown.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {};
// obj?.prop = 10; // This is a SyntaxError.
\`\`\`
The language designers made this decision to avoid ambiguity. The correct way to perform this conditional assignment would be: \`if (obj) { obj.prop = 10; }\`.

  "typeof-undeclared-variable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a unique and sometimes useful quirk of the \`typeof\` operator. It is the only operator that can be used on a variable that has not been declared at all without throwing a \`ReferenceError\`. In this case, it will simply return the string \`"undefined"\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example.
\`\`\`javascript
// Assume 'undeclaredVar' has not been declared anywhere.
typeof undeclaredVar; // returns "undefined"
// undeclaredVar; // would throw a ReferenceError

  "spread-clone-and-mutate": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem reinforces that the spread syntax for objects (\`...\`) creates a **sh shallow copy**. It copies the top-level properties. If one of those properties is an object or array, the *reference* to that nested object is copied, not the object itself.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A nested object is mutated in the copy, affecting the original.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = { a: 1, nested: { b: 2 } };
const copy = { ...original };

copy.nested.b = 99;

  "type-coercion-in-loose-equality": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows an infamous example of JavaScript's complex type coercion rules for loose equality (\`==\`). The expression \`[] == ![]\` evaluates to \`true\`, which is highly unintuitive.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The expression is evaluated step-by-step:
1. \`![]\` (NOT operator on an array): An array is a truthy value. \`!true\` is \`false\`. The expression becomes \`[] == false\`.
2. \`[] == false\`: The loose equality algorithm sees an object and a boolean. It converts the boolean to a number (\`false\` -> \`0\`). The expression becomes \`[] == 0\`.
3. \`[] == 0\`: The algorithm now sees an object and a number. It tries to convert the object to a primitive. \`[].toString()\` results in \`""\` (empty string). The expression becomes \`"" == 0\`.
4. \`"" == 0\`: The algorithm sees a string and a number. It converts the string to a number (\`""\` -> \`0\`). The expression becomes \`0 == 0\`.
5. \`0 == 0\` is \`true\`.

  "bitwise-or-for-rounding": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a bitwise trick for fast truncation. A bitwise OR with 0 (\`n | 0\`) forces the number to be converted to a 32-bit integer, which effectively truncates any decimal part. It's similar to \`~~n\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is applied to a decimal number.
\`\`\`javascript
15.75 | 0; // 15

  "optional-chaining-with-function-call": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows another use case for optional chaining. The \`?.()\` syntax allows you to safely *call* a function that might not exist on an object. If the property exists and is a function, it gets called. If it doesn't exist or is not a function, the expression short-circuits and returns \`undefined\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt is made to call an existing and a non-existing method.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {
  run: () => "Ran!"
};

obj.run?.();   // "Ran!"
obj.stop?.();  // undefined

  "bitwise-extracting-rgba-parts": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows a practical application of bitwise operators. A 32-bit RGBA color is often stored as a single integer. Bitwise shifting and masking can be used to extract these individual channel values.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The channels of \`#FF0000FF\` (opaque red) are extracted.
\`\`\`javascript
const color = 0xFF0000FF;

const red   = (color >> 24) & 0xFF; // 255
const green = (color >> 16) & 0xFF; // 0
const blue  = (color >> 8)  & 0xFF; // 0
const alpha = color & 0xFF;         // 255
\`\`\`
1. **Shifting**: The \`>>\` operator moves the desired 8-bit channel to the far right.
2. **Masking**: The \`& 0xFF\` operation isolates just those 8 bits.

  "in-operator-on-arrays": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a common point of confusion. When used on an array, the \`in\` operator checks for the existence of an **index** (which is a property key), not for the existence of a **value**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`in\` operator is used to check for an index and a value.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
'1' in arr; // true (because the index '1' exists)
'b' in arr; // false (it's a value, not an index)
\`\`\`
To check for the presence of a value, you should use \`arr.includes('b')\`.

  "logical-operators-with-objects": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how logical operators work with non-boolean values, specifically objects. In JavaScript, all objects (including empty objects and arrays) are **truthy**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Logical operators are used with object literals.
\`\`\`javascript
const a = { val: 1 };
const b = { val: 2 };
const nullValue = null;

(a && b); // returns b, because 'a' is truthy
(nullValue || b); // returns b, because null is falsy

  "bitwise-xor-for-encryption": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows a simplified conceptual use of the bitwise XOR operator. XOR has the property that \`(A ^ K) ^ K = A\`. This means if you XOR a message with a key to "encrypt" it, you can XOR the encrypted result with the same key to get the original message back.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A number is encrypted and then decrypted with a key.
\`\`\`javascript
const message = 12345;
const key = 54321;

const encrypted = message ^ key;
const decrypted = encrypted ^ key; // This will be 12345

  "ternary-vs-if-else": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a key difference between the ternary operator and an \`if/else\` block.
- **Ternary Operator (\`? :\`)**: Is an **expression**, which means it evaluates to a value.
- **\`if/else\`**: Is a **statement**, which means it performs an action but does not evaluate to a value itself.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This difference determines where they can be used.
\`\`\`javascript
// GOOD: Ternary can be used in an assignment because it's an expression.
const message = age >= 18 ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';

// BAD: if/else is a statement and cannot be used in an assignment.
// const message = if (age >= 18) { 'Adult' } else { 'Minor' }; // SyntaxError

  "spread-to-remove-duplicates": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows a very common and idiomatic way to remove duplicate values from an array in modern JavaScript. It combines the \`Set\` data structure (which only stores unique values) with the spread syntax.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The pattern is applied to an array with duplicates.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 2, 3];
const unique = [...new Set(arr)]; // [1, 2, 3]
\`\`\`
1. \`new Set(arr)\`: Creates a \`Set\` object from the array, automatically discarding the duplicate \`2\`. The result is \`{1, 2, 3}\`.
2. \`[... ]\`: The spread syntax converts the \`Set\` back into an array.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`Set\`**: The ideal data structure for handling uniqueness.
- **Spread Syntax**: A concise way to convert iterables (like a \`Set\`) into an array.

  // problem explanation--> 172
  "optional-chaining-pitfall": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights an important rule for the optional chaining operator (\`?.\`). It only "short-circuits" for \`null\` or \`undefined\`. It does **not** stop for other "falsy" values like \`0\`, \`""\`, or \`false\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt to access a property on the number \`0\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const data = { count: 0 };

// This will throw a TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')
// const result = data.missing?.toString(); // this part is fine, result is undefined

// This will throw a TypeError: Cannot read properties of number (reading 'toString')
// because 0 is not nullish, the chain continues
// const result = data.count?.toString(); // Fails!
\`\`\`
The expression \`data.count?.toString()\` fails because \`data.count\` is \`0\`, which is not \`null\` or \`undefined\`, so the chain continues and tries to access \`.toString\` on the number primitive \`0\`, which is not an error itself, but the example in the solver is flawed. Let's correct the concept.
A better example is: \`data.missing?.length\` is \`undefined\`, but \`data.count?.length\` would be \`undefined\` as well, because \`0\` has no length property. The point is \`?.\` doesn't stop for \`0\`.
