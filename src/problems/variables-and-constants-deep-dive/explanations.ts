  "declare-with-var": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem covers the original way to declare variables in JavaScript using the \`var\` keyword. Variables declared with \`var\` are function-scoped or globally-scoped.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable named \`myVar\` is declared and assigned a value.
\`\`\`javascript
var myVar = 'Hello';
return \`Declared myVar with value: "\${myVar}"\`;
\`\`\`
While still functional, \`var\` has been largely superseded by \`let\` and \`const\` in modern JavaScript because of its sometimes confusing hoisting and scoping rules.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`var\`**: A keyword for declaring a function-scoped or globally-scoped variable.
- **Function Scope**: Variables declared with \`var\` are accessible anywhere within the function they are defined in, regardless of block boundaries.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 02
  "declare-with-let": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The \`let\` keyword, introduced in ES6 (2015), is the modern way to declare variables whose values might need to change. The key feature of \`let\` is that it is **block-scoped**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable named \`myLet\` is declared and assigned a number.
\`\`\`javascript
let myLet = 100;
return \`Declared myLet with value: \${myLet}\`;
\`\`\`
Using \`let\` is preferred over \`var\` because its block-scoping behavior is more intuitive and helps prevent common bugs related to scope.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`let\`**: A keyword for declaring a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
- **Block Scope**: The scope created by a pair of curly braces \`{}\`. A variable declared with \`let\` only exists within that block.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 03
  "declare-with-const": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The \`const\` keyword is used to declare "constants" – variables whose values are not intended to be changed after they are first assigned. It's important to understand that \`const\` protects the variable's *binding* (the reference), not the value itself if it's an object or array. Like \`let\`, it is **block-scoped**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A constant named \`myConst\` is declared and assigned a string.
\`\`\`javascript
const myConst = 'Constant';
return \`Declared myConst with value: "\${myConst}"\`;
\`\`\`
Modern best practice is to use \`const\` by default and only switch to \`let\` if you know the variable needs to be reassigned.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`const\`**: A keyword for declaring a block-scoped constant whose binding is immutable.
- **Immutability (of binding)**: The variable identifier cannot be reassigned to point to a new value.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 04
  "reassign-let-variable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the primary feature of variables declared with \`let\`: they are mutable and can be reassigned to a new value after their initial declaration.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is initialized and then its value is updated.
\`\`\`javascript
let reassignable = "Initial";
reassignable = "Reassigned";
return \`Final value: "\${reassignable}"\`;
\`\`\`
The variable \`reassignable\` successfully points to a new string value.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Reassignment**: The ability to change the value a variable holds. This is the main characteristic of \`let\` compared to \`const\`.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 05
  "const-reassignment-primitive": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows the core rule of \`const\`: a constant cannot be reassigned. When the value is a primitive type (like a number, string, or boolean), this effectively makes the value immutable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code attempts to reassign a constant, which throws a \`TypeError\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const myConst = 10;
myConst = 20; // This line will throw a TypeError
\`\`\`
The solver catches this expected error. This behavior is desirable because it prevents accidental changes to values that should remain constant throughout the program.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`TypeError\`**: The specific error thrown when trying to reassign a constant variable.
- **Immutability**: For primitive types, \`const\` provides true immutability.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 06
  "uninitialized-variable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates what happens when a variable is declared but not given an initial value. In JavaScript, such variables are automatically initialized with the special value \`undefined\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is declared with \`let\` without an assignment operator.
\`\`\`javascript
let myVar;
console.log(myVar); // undefined
\`\`\`
The initial value is \`undefined\`, and its type is also \`"undefined"\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`undefined\`**: A primitive value in JavaScript that represents the absence of a value.
- **Initialization**: The process of assigning an initial value to a variable.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 07
  "const-must-be-initialized": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Unlike \`let\` or \`var\`, constants declared with \`const\` *must\` be given a value at the same time they are declared. Failing to do so results in a \`SyntaxError\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual problem showing invalid syntax.
\`\`\`javascript
// This is invalid code and will not run
const myConst; 
// SyntaxError: 'const' declarations must be initialized.
\`\`\`
The reason for this rule is that a \`const\` cannot be reassigned later, so if it weren't initialized at declaration, it could never be given a value.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`SyntaxError\`**: An error that occurs when the JavaScript engine encounters code that violates the language's syntax rules.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 08
  "variable-naming-rules": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript has specific rules for variable names (identifiers):
1.  They must start with a letter, an underscore (\`_\`), or a dollar sign (\`$\`).
2.  After the first character, they can also contain numbers.
3.  They are case-sensitive.
4.  They cannot be a reserved keyword (like \`if\`, \`let\`, \`const\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code demonstrates valid and invalid names.
\`\`\`javascript
// Valid
const _name = 'Underscore';
const $name = 'Dollar';
const name1 = 'Letter then number';

// Invalid
// const 1name = 'Starts with number'; // SyntaxError
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Identifiers**: The names given to variables, functions, and other parts of a program.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 09
  "case-sensitivity": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A key rule for JavaScript identifiers is that they are case-sensitive. This means \`myVariable\`, \`MyVariable\`, and \`myvariable\` are treated as three completely different variables.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Two variables are declared with names that differ only by case.
\`\`\`javascript
let myVariable = "lowercase v";
let myvariable = "all lowercase";
\`\`\`
The code shows that they hold different values and do not interfere with each other. While possible, using variable names that only differ by case is generally considered bad practice as it can be confusing.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Case-Sensitivity**: A fundamental property of the JavaScript language.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 10
  "type-of-variable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The \`typeof\` operator is a unary operator that returns a string indicating the data type of the unevaluated operand. It's a fundamental tool for inspecting the type of a variable at runtime.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The operator is used on variables holding different primitive types.
\`\`\`javascript
const str = "hello"; // typeof is "string"
const num = 42;      // typeof is "number"
const bool = true;   // typeof is "boolean"
\`\`\`
The result of the \`typeof\` operator is always a string.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`typeof\` operator**: The primary way to check the primitive type of a value.
- **Primitive Types**: The basic data types in JavaScript: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 11
  "dynamic-typing": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript is a dynamically-typed (or loosely-typed) language. This means you do not have to specify the type of a variable when you declare it, and the type can change at runtime when you reassign the variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is first assigned a number and then reassigned to a string. The \`typeof\` operator confirms that the variable's type has changed.
\`\`\`javascript
let dynamicVar = 123;
// typeof dynamicVar is "number"

dynamicVar = "hello";
// typeof dynamicVar is now "string"
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Typing**: A core feature of languages like JavaScript and Python, contrasting with statically-typed languages like Java or C#.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 12
  "declare-multiple-variables": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript allows you to declare (and optionally initialize) multiple variables in a single statement, separated by commas.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Three variables are declared and initialized in one line using a single \`let\` keyword.
\`\`\`javascript
let a = 1, b = 2, c = 3;
\`\`\`
While this syntax is compact, modern code style often prefers declaring each variable on its own line for better readability.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Syntax Sugar**: A more concise syntax for a common operation.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 13
  "string-concatenation-vars": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The addition operator (\`+\`) is used for both adding numbers and concatenating strings. When used with string variables, it joins them together to form a new string.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Two string variables are joined with a space literal in between.
\`\`\`javascript
const firstName = "John";
const lastName = "Doe";
const fullName = firstName + " " + lastName; // "John Doe"
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Operator Overloading**: The \`+\` operator performs a different action based on the types of its operands.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 14
  "template-literals-vars": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Template literals (or template strings) are an ES6 feature that provides a more powerful and readable way to create strings, especially when embedding variables. They are enclosed in backticks (\` \`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Variables are embedded directly into the string using the \`\${variableName}\` syntax.
\`\`\`javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 30;
const sentence = \`\${name} is \${age} years old.\`;
\`\`\`
This is much cleaner than traditional concatenation: \`name + ' is ' + age + ' years old.'\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Template Literals**: A modern string syntax in JavaScript.
- **String Interpolation**: The process of embedding expressions or variables within a string literal.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 15
  "null-vs-undefined": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights the difference between two primitive values that both represent "no value".
- **\`undefined\`**: The default value of a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value. It means a value has not been set yet.
- **\`null\`**: A value that must be explicitly assigned. It represents the intentional absence of any object value.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`typeof\` operator is used to show a key difference.
\`\`\`javascript
let uninitialized; // value is undefined, typeof is "undefined"
let noValue = null; // value is null, typeof is "object"
\`\`\`
The fact that \`typeof null\` returns \`"object"\` is a famous, long-standing bug in JavaScript that cannot be changed for backward compatibility.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`undefined\` vs. \`null\`**: A subtle but important distinction in JavaScript.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 16
  "shorthand-property-names": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
ES6 introduced a concise syntax for creating object literals when the keys of the object have the same name as the variables you want to assign to them.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An object is created from two variables.
\`\`\`javascript
const name = "Alice";
const age = 25;

// Instead of { name: name, age: age }
const user = { name, age }; 
\`\`\`
If the variable name and the desired property name are identical, you only need to write the name once.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Shorthand Property Names**: A syntax sugar feature from ES6 that makes object creation more concise.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 17
  "nan-is-weird": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
\`NaN\` (Not a Number) is a special numeric value that results from an operation that cannot produce a valid number (e.g., \`0 / 0\` or \`Math.sqrt(-1)\`). It has a unique property: it is not equal to anything, including itself.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code shows that \`NaN === NaN\` is false. The correct way to check if a value is \`NaN\` is to use the \`Number.isNaN()\` function.
\`\`\`javascript
NaN === NaN; // false
Number.isNaN(NaN); // true
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`NaN\`**: A special value of the number type.
- **\`Number.isNaN()\`**: The modern, reliable function for checking for \`NaN\`.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 18
  "destructure-swap-variables": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a modern, elegant ES6 feature for swapping the values of two variables without needing a temporary third variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Array destructuring is used to perform the swap in a single line.
\`\`\`javascript
let a = 1;
let b = 2;

// The old way:
// const temp = a;
// a = b;
// b = temp;

// The new way:
[a, b] = [b, a];
\`\`\`
On the right side, a new array \`[2, 1]\` is created. Then, destructuring assignment unpacks these values back into the variables \`a\` and \`b\` in the new order.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Array Destructuring**: A powerful syntax for extracting values from arrays.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 19
  "destructure-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Array destructuring is an ES6 feature that allows you to "unpack" values from arrays into distinct variables in a concise way.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Values from an array literal are assigned to two new constants.
\`\`\`javascript
const coordinates = [10, 20];
const [x, y] = coordinates;

// x is 10, y is 20
\`\`\`
The assignment is based on the position of the elements in the array.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Destructuring Assignment**: A syntax that makes it easy to extract data from arrays or objects.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 20
  "destructure-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Object destructuring is the counterpart to array destructuring. It allows you to unpack properties from objects into distinct variables.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Properties from an object literal are assigned to new constants.
\`\`\`javascript
const user = { name: 'Bob', age: 40 };
const { name, age } = user;

// name is "Bob", age is 40
\`\`\`
The assignment is based on the property names. The variable names must match the property keys.

  // problem explanation--> 21
  "when-to-use-let-vs-const": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about modern JavaScript best practices for variable declaration.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The rule of thumb is:
1.  **Default to \`const\`**: Always start by declaring variables with \`const\`. This signals that the variable's reference should not be changed, which makes the code easier to reason about and prevents accidental reassignments.
2.  **Use \`let\` only when necessary**: If you know that a variable's value needs to be reassigned later (e.g., a loop counter, a state variable that gets updated), then use \`let\`.
3.  **Avoid \`var\`**: In modern codebases, \`var\` should generally be avoided due to its confusing scoping and hoisting rules.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Code Readability**: Using \`const\` clearly communicates intent.
- **Immutability**: Favoring immutability leads to more predictable and safer code.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 22
  "destructure-from-function-return-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Destructuring can be combined with function calls. If a function returns an array, you can immediately destructure its return value into variables.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function returns an array, and its result is destructured.
\`\`\`javascript
function getCoords() {
  return [5, 10];
}

const [x, y] = getCoords();
// x becomes 5, y becomes 10
\`\`\`
This makes for very clean and expressive code, avoiding the need for a temporary variable to hold the array.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Function Composition**: Combining different language features (functions and destructuring) to write elegant code.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 23
  "destructure-from-function-return-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Similar to destructuring an array return, if a function returns an object, you can immediately destructure its properties into variables.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function returns an object, and its properties are destructured.
\`\`\`javascript
function getUser() {
  return { id: 123, name: 'Frank' };
}

const { id, name } = getUser();
// id becomes 123, name becomes "Frank"
\`\`\`
This is an extremely common pattern when working with functions that return structured data.

  // problem explanation--> 24
  "redeclare-var": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a peculiar and often problematic feature of \`var\`. A variable declared with \`var\` can be declared again in the same scope without causing an error. The second declaration simply acts as an assignment.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable \`x\` is declared twice with \`var\`.
\`\`\`javascript
var x = 1;
var x = 2; // This is allowed
console.log(x); // 2
\`\`\`
This behavior can lead to bugs where a variable is accidentally redeclared in a large codebase.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Variable Redeclaration**: A behavior allowed by \`var\` but prohibited by \`let\` and \`const\`.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 25
  "redeclare-let-error": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
In contrast to \`var\`, \`let\` and \`const\` were designed to be safer. They do not allow a variable to be redeclared in the same scope. This prevents accidental redeclaration bugs.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual problem showing invalid syntax.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 1;
let x = 2; // This line will throw a SyntaxError
\`\`\`
The JavaScript engine will refuse to run this code, citing that the identifier 'x' has already been declared.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`SyntaxError\`**: An error indicating that the code does not conform to the rules of the language.
- **Safer Scoping Rules**: A key improvement of \`let\` and \`const\` over \`var\`.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 26
  "global-scope-var": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
When a variable is declared with \`var\` outside of any function, it is added to the **global scope**. Variables in the global scope are accessible from anywhere in the program, including inside functions.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A global variable is declared and then accessed from within a function.
\`\`\`javascript
var globalVar = "Hi";
function test() {
  console.log(globalVar); // Accesses the global variable
}
test(); // "Hi"
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Global Scope**: The outermost scope in a JavaScript program.
- **Scope Chain**: The mechanism by which the function looks outside its own scope to find the \`globalVar\` variable.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 27
  "function-scope-var": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Variables declared with \`var\` are **function-scoped**. This means they are accessible anywhere within the function in which they are declared, but not outside of it.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is declared inside a function. Trying to access it outside the function results in an error.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  var funcVar = "Local";
}
// console.log(funcVar); // Throws a ReferenceError
\`\`\`
This behavior is a fundamental way JavaScript provides encapsulation, keeping a function's internal variables private.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Function Scope**: The scope created by a function.
- **Encapsulation**: The principle of bundling data and the methods that operate on that data together, and restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 28
  "block-scope-let": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
ES6 introduced \`let\` and \`const\`, which are **block-scoped**. A block is any section of code within curly braces \`{}\` (e.g., in an \`if\` statement or a \`for\` loop). Variables declared with \`let\` are only accessible within that block.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is declared with \`let\` inside an \`if\` block. It is not accessible after the block ends.
\`\`\`javascript
if (true) {
    let blockVar = "In block";
}
// console.log(blockVar); // Throws a ReferenceError
\`\`\`
This more granular scoping is generally safer and less error-prone than the function-scoping of \`var\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Block Scope**: The scope created by a pair of curly braces.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 29
  "block-scope-const": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Like \`let\`, constants declared with \`const\` are also **block-scoped**. They only exist within the block in which they are defined.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A constant is declared inside an \`if\` block. It cannot be accessed outside.
\`\`\`javascript
if (true) {
    const blockConst = "In block";
}
// console.log(blockConst); // Throws a ReferenceError
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Block Scope**: A key feature of modern variable declarations in JavaScript.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 30
  "var-no-block-scope": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a major difference between \`var\` and \`let\`/\`const\`. Variables declared with \`var\` are **not** block-scoped; they are function-scoped. This means a \`var\` declared inside a block (like an \`if\` or \`for\` loop) "leaks" out into the containing function's scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable is declared with \`var\` inside an \`if\` block and is successfully accessed outside of it.
\`\`\`javascript
if (true) {
    var noBlock = "Visible outside";
}
console.log(noBlock); // "Visible outside"
\`\`\`
This behavior can lead to bugs where variables from a loop overwrite other variables, and is a primary reason to prefer \`let\` and \`const\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Function Scope vs. Block Scope**: A critical distinction between \`var\` and the newer \`let\`/\`const\`.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 31
  "global-scope-let": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Just like \`var\`, a variable declared with \`let\` at the top level (outside any function) is in the global scope and is accessible from anywhere in the program.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A global \`let\` is accessed from within a function.
\`\`\`javascript
let globalLet = "Hi";
function test() {
  console.log(globalLet); // "Hi"
}
\`\`\`
The main difference from a global \`var\` is that a global \`let\` does not become a property on the \`window\` object in browsers.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Global Scope**: The top-level scope accessible by all parts of the program.

  // problem explanation--> 32
  "shadowing-global-variable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
"Shadowing" occurs when a variable declared in a certain scope (e.g., a local scope) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. When this happens, the inner variable takes precedence within its scope, temporarily "hiding" or "shadowing" the outer variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A local variable \`color\` shadows the global variable of the same name.
\`\`\`javascript
let color = 'blue'; // Global variable
function showColor() {
  let color = 'green'; // Local variable, shadows the global one
  return \`The color inside the function is \${color}.\`; // 'green'
}
// The global variable is unaffected.

- **Variable Shadowing**: A situation where a variable in an inner scope hides a variable from an outer scope.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 33
  "const-array-reassignment-error": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem clarifies the behavior of \`const\` with reference types like arrays. \`const\` prevents the variable from being reassigned to a *new* reference, but it does not make the array itself immutable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt is made to assign a new array to a variable declared with \`const\`, resulting in a \`TypeError\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3); // This is allowed
// arr = [3, 4]; // This would throw a TypeError
\`\`\`
The solver catches the expected error. You can modify the *contents* of the array, but you cannot make the variable point to a different array.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Binding vs. Value**: \`const\` makes the binding immutable, not the value being pointed to.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 34
  "destructure-skip-array-items": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Array destructuring provides a syntax to skip elements you are not interested in. You can simply omit a variable name and use a comma as a placeholder.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The second element of an array is skipped during destructuring.
\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [a, , c] = numbers;
// a is 1
// The element at index 1 (value 2) is skipped
// c is 3

  // problem explanation--> 35
  "practical-let-for-state": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a common, practical use case for \`let\`: managing a state that changes over time. A counter that needs to be incremented is a perfect example of a variable that must be reassigned.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A counter variable is declared with \`let\` outside a function. The function modifies this external state.
\`\`\`javascript
let counter = 0;
function increment() {
  counter++;
}
increment();
increment();
// counter is now 2
\`\`\`
Because the \`counter\` variable needs to be reassigned, \`let\` is the correct choice.

  // problem explanation--> 36
  "practical-const-for-config": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A common use for \`const\` is to declare configuration values that should never change during the program's execution, such as API keys, URLs, or settings.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A configuration object is declared with \`const\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const CONFIG = {
  API_URL: 'https://api.example.com',
  TIMEOUT: 5000
};
\`\`\`
Using \`const\` makes the code's intent clear (this configuration should not be changed) and prevents accidental modification of the reference to the config object.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Configuration Management**: Storing application settings in a clear and safe way.

  // problem explanation--> 37
  "variable-shadowing": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
"Shadowing" occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. Inside the inner scope, any reference to that variable name will resolve to the inner variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable \`x\` in an inner function shadows the \`x\` from the outer scope.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 'outer';
function test() {
  let x = 'inner'; // This 'x' is completely separate
  console.log(x); // 'inner'
}
test();
console.log(x); // 'outer'
\`\`\`
The inner \`x\` only exists within the \`test\` function. The outer \`x\` is unaffected.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Variable Shadowing**: A direct consequence of how lexical scoping works.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 38
  "lexical-scoping": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript uses **lexical scoping** (also known as static scoping). This means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code. An inner function can access variables from its outer, containing function because of where it was *defined*, not where it was *called*.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`child\` function is defined inside the scope of the \`parent\` function, so it has access to \`parentVar\`.
\`\`\`javascript
function parent() {
  let parentVar = 'Parent';
  function child() {
    // child's lexical environment contains a reference to parent's environment
    console.log(parentVar); // 'Parent'
  }
  child();
}
\`\`\`
This forms a "closure," where the inner function "closes over" the variables of its parent.

  "scope-chain": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The scope chain is the mechanism that allows a function to access variables from its containing scopes. When a variable is used, the JavaScript engine searches the current scope. If it's not found, it searches the immediate outer scope, then the next outer scope, and so on, up to the global scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A deeply nested function \`child\` accesses variables from both its immediate parent and its grandparent scopes.
\`\`\`javascript
let grandparent = 'L1';
function parent() {
  let parent = 'L2';
  function child() {
    // Searches its own scope (finds nothing),
    // then parent's scope (finds 'parent'),
    // then grandparent's (global) scope (finds 'grandparent').
    return \`Can see \${parent} and \${grandparent}.\`;
  }
  return child();
}
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Scope Chain**: The ordered list of scopes that are searched to resolve a variable's value.

  "iife-scope": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
An Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) is a design pattern used to create a new scope. By wrapping a function in parentheses and executing it immediately, you can declare variables that will not leak into the surrounding (often global) scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An IIFE creates a private variable \`privateVar\`.
\`\`\`javascript
(function() {
  var privateVar = "I'm private";
  // This variable only exists inside these parentheses.
})();
// console.log(privateVar); // Throws a ReferenceError
\`\`\`
This was a very common pattern for creating privacy before ES6 modules became the standard.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **IIFE**: A pattern for creating privacy.
- **Global Scope Pollution**: IIFEs help prevent adding unnecessary variables to the global scope.

  // problem explanation--> 41
  "let-in-for-loop": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a key feature of \`let\` in \`for\` loops. When you use \`let\` to declare the loop counter, JavaScript creates a *new* binding for that variable for each iteration of the loop. This is crucial for closures created inside loops.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A loop creates asynchronous callbacks. Because \`let\` is used, each callback captures the value of \`i\` from its specific iteration.
\`\`\`javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // Each timeout has its own 'i'
    console.log(i); 
  }, 10);
}
// Output will be: 0, 1, 2
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Block Scope**: \`let\` is block-scoped.
- **Loop Variable Binding**: The new binding per iteration is a special behavior of \`let\` in loops that solves many common problems.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 42
  "var-in-for-loop-pitfall": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows the classic problem with using \`var\` in loops with closures. Because \`var\` is function-scoped, there is only *one* \`i\` variable for the entire loop. By the time the asynchronous \`setTimeout\` callbacks run, the loop has already finished, and the single \`i\` variable holds its final value (3).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The callbacks all reference the same shared \`i\` variable.
\`\`\`javascript
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    // All three callbacks see the final value of 'i'
    console.log(i);
  }, 10);
}
// Output will be: 3, 3, 3
\`\`\`
This behavior was a very common source of bugs for junior developers, and is a primary reason \`let\` was introduced.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Function Scope**: \`var\` creates a single variable for the entire function containing the loop.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 43
  "window-object-global-var": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
In a browser environment, the global scope is represented by the \`window\` object. When you declare a variable with \`var\` in the global scope, it becomes a property of the \`window\` object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual problem for a browser context.
\`\`\`javascript
var myGlobal = 'hello';
console.log(window.myGlobal === myGlobal); // true
\`\`\`
This can lead to accidentally overwriting built-in properties of the \`window\` object and is generally considered bad practice.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Global Object**: The \`window\` object in browsers.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 44
  "window-object-global-let": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
ES6 changed the behavior for global variables declared with \`let\` and \`const\`. Unlike \`var\`, they are still in the global scope, but they do **not** become properties of the global \`window\` object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual problem for a browser context.
\`\`\`javascript
let myGlobal = 'hello';
console.log(window.myGlobal); // undefined
\`\`\`
This change helps to keep the global namespace cleaner and prevents accidental overwrites of \`window\` properties.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Global Lexical Environment**: \`let\` and \`const\` at the global level live in a separate conceptual space from the properties of the \`window\` object.

  "undeclared-variable-global": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a behavior of non-strict mode that can cause serious bugs. If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, JavaScript automatically creates a global variable with that name without causing an error. This is called a "global leak".

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function accidentally creates a global variable.
\`\`\`javascript
// non-strict mode
function createLeak() {
  myLeakedVar = "oops"; // No let, const, or var
}
createLeak();
// console.log(myLeakedVar); // "oops" - it's now global!

  "strict-mode-undeclared": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
"Strict mode" is a feature that enables a more restrictive set of rules for JavaScript, catching common errors and preventing unsafe actions. One of its key benefits is that it prevents accidental global leaks.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Assigning to an undeclared variable in strict mode throws a \`ReferenceError\`.
\`\`\`javascript
'use strict';
function noLeak() {
  // myLeakedVar = "oops"; // This would throw a ReferenceError
}

  "scope-of-catch-block": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The error variable declared in a \`catch\` block has its own special scope. It is **block-scoped** to the \`catch\` block itself and is not accessible outside of it.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`err\` variable only exists inside the \`catch\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  throw new Error('test error');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // 'test error'

  "hoisting-var-declaration": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variable and function declarations are conceptually moved to the top of their scope before code execution. For variables declared with \`var\`, only the *declaration* is hoisted, not the *initialization* (assignment).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`var\` is accessed before its assignment.
\`\`\`javascript
// During compilation, this is treated as:
// var myVar;
// console.log(myVar);
// myVar = 5;

console.log(myVar); // logs 'undefined'
var myVar = 5;
\`\`\`
The variable exists due to hoisting, but its value is \`undefined\` until the assignment line is reached.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Hoisting**: A core JavaScript behavior.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 49
  "hoisting-function-declaration": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Unlike \`var\` declarations, **function declarations** are fully hoisted. This means the entire function, including its body, is moved to the top of the scope, allowing you to call it before it appears in your code.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The conceptual code shows this behavior.
\`\`\`javascript
// This works because the entire function is hoisted.
const result = hoistedFunc(); 

function hoistedFunc() {
  return 'I was hoisted!';
}
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Function Hoisting**: A specific hoisting rule that applies only to function declarations.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 50
  "hoisting-function-expression": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Function expressions (where a function is assigned to a variable) are **not** fully hoisted. If assigned to a \`var\`, the variable declaration is hoisted, but the function assignment is not. This leads to a \`TypeError\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt is made to call a function expression before its assignment.
\`\`\`javascript
// The code is interpreted as:
// var expressionFunc;
// expressionFunc(); // TypeError: expressionFunc is not a function
// expressionFunc = function() { ... };

try {
  expressionFunc(); 
} catch(e) {
  console.log(e.name); // "TypeError"
}
var expressionFunc = function() {};

  // problem explanation--> 51
  "temporal-dead-zone-let": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Variables declared with \`let\` and \`const\` are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. The period from the start of the block until the declaration is reached is called the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**. Accessing the variable within the TDZ results in a \`ReferenceError\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt is made to access a \`let\` variable before its declaration.
\`\`\`javascript
// The start of the TDZ for myLet
// console.log(myLet); // Throws a ReferenceError
// The end of the TDZ for myLet
let myLet = 5; 
\`\`\`
This prevents bugs that could occur with \`var\` where a variable might be used while its value is still \`undefined\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: The state where a variable has been hoisted but cannot be accessed.
- **\`ReferenceError\`**: The error thrown when accessing a variable in its TDZ.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 52
  "temporal-dead-zone-const": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Like \`let\`, constants declared with \`const\` are also subject to the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). They are hoisted but cannot be accessed before their declaration.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt to access a \`const\` in its TDZ.
\`\`\`javascript
// TDZ for myConst starts

  "var-redeclared-in-function": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates how \`var\` hoisting works within a function, even when an outer variable has the same name.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The local \`var x\` declaration is hoisted to the top of the function.
\`\`\`javascript
var x = "global";
function test() {
  // Hoisting makes the code behave like this:
  // var x;
  // console.log(x); // 'undefined'
  // x = 'local';
  
  console.log(x); 
  var x = 'local';
}
test();
\`\`\`
The local \`x\` is hoisted, shadowing the global \`x\`. When it's logged, it exists but is \`undefined\`, not "global".

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Hoisting**: Hoisting is scope-specific. A function-scoped \`var\` is hoisted to the top of its function.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 54
  "hoisting-in-strict-mode": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. Strict mode does not change the fundamental hoisting behavior of \`var\` (declaration hoisted, assignment not) or functions (fully hoisted). However, it introduces other errors that make some hoisting-related bugs easier to find. For example, strict mode prevents accidental global variable creation, which is a common issue related to scope and hoisting.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Strict Mode**: While not changing hoisting directly, it makes the language safer overall.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 55
  "const-mutate-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a crucial concept for \`const\`. When you declare an object with \`const\`, it means the variable's *reference* to the object is constant. It does **not** mean the object's contents are constant. The object itself is still mutable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A property of a \`const\` object is changed.
\`\`\`javascript
const person = { name: 'John' };
person.name = 'Jane'; // This is perfectly valid.
// person = {}; // This would be a TypeError.
\`\`\`
The reference stored in \`person\` hasn't changed; it still points to the same object in memory.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Reference vs. Value**: \`const\` protects the reference, not the underlying value for objects and arrays.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 56
  "const-mutate-array": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Similar to objects, when an array is declared with \`const\`, the variable holds a constant reference to the array. The contents of the array itself can be freely changed.

Elements are added and modified in a \`const\` array.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3);    // OK
arr[0] = 0;       // OK
// arr = [4, 5]; // This would be a TypeError.

  "const-reassign-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows the direct consequence of the \`const\` rule. It is a \`TypeError\` to attempt to assign a new object reference to a variable that was declared with \`const\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code attempts to reassign a constant variable holding an object.
\`\`\`javascript
const person = { name: 'Alice' };
// person = { name: 'Bob' }; // Throws TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

  // problem explanation--> 58
  "object-freeze": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
If you need an object to be truly immutable (meaning its properties cannot be changed, added, or removed), you can use \`Object.freeze()\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An object is frozen, and an attempt to mutate it fails.
\`\`\`javascript
'use strict'; // In strict mode, this will throw an error.
const frozenObj = { a: 1 };
Object.freeze(frozenObj);
// frozenObj.a = 2; // Throws a TypeError in strict mode.
\`\`\`
In non-strict mode, the mutation fails silently. It's important to note that \`Object.freeze()\` is shallow.

- **\`Object.freeze()\`**: A method for making an object immutable.
- **Immutability**: A programming paradigm that helps prevent bugs by avoiding shared, mutable state.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 59
  "const-in-for-of-loop": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a specific behavior of \`for...of\` loops. You can safely use \`const\` to declare the loop variable because a *new* binding is created for each iteration of the loop.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`for...of\` loop uses \`const\` for its loop variable.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
for (const item of arr) {
  // 'item' is a new constant in each iteration.
  console.log(item);
}
\`\`\`
This works because the loop is not trying to *reassign* the \`item\` variable in subsequent iterations; it's creating a fresh one each time.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Loop Variable Binding**: The \`for...of\` loop has special semantics for how its variable is bound in each iteration.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 60
  "const-in-for-loop-error": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
In contrast to a \`for...of\` loop, a classic \`for\` loop cannot use \`const\` for its counter. The reason is that the final expression of the loop (e.g., \`i++\`) attempts to *reassign* the counter variable, which violates the rule of \`const\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual problem showing invalid syntax.

A default value is provided for \`b\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const numbers = [10];

A nested destructuring pattern is used to extract the \`name\` property directly.
\`\`\`javascript
const data = { user: { name: 'David' } };
const { user: { name } } = data;
// name is 'David'
\`\`\`
The pattern \`{ user: { name } }\` says: "Go into the \`data\` object, find the \`user\` property, go into that object, find its \`name\` property, and assign its value to a new variable called \`name\`."

  // problem explanation--> 67
  "destructure-function-params-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A very common and powerful pattern is to use object destructuring directly in a function's parameter list. This allows the function to accept a single "options" object and easily access its properties with default values.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The function signature destructures the incoming object.
\`\`\`javascript
function greet({ name, greeting = 'Hello' }) {
  return \`\${greeting}, \${name}!\`;
}
// The function is called with an object
greet({ name: 'Eve' }); // "Hello, Eve!"

  "destructure-for-of-loop": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Destructuring is especially useful inside loops, particularly \`for...of\`, when iterating over an array of arrays or an array of objects.

This demonstrates a common error. Destructuring works by trying to access properties on a source value. If that source value is \`null\` or \`undefined\`, it has no properties, so the attempt to access them results in a \`TypeError\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code attempts to destructure a \`null\` value.
\`\`\`javascript
const source = null;

A function returns an object with a missing property. The destructuring assignment provides a default for it.
\`\`\`javascript
const getPartialData = () => ({ a: 1 });
const { a, b = 'default' } = getPartialData();
// a is 1

  "let-block-scope-in-standalone-block": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem shows that a block doesn't need to be part of an \`if\`, \`for\`, or \`while\` statement to create a scope. A simple pair of curly braces \`{}\` anywhere in your code will create a new block scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A standalone block is used to create a temporary, private scope.

  "primitive-wrapper-objects": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a behind-the-scenes mechanism in JavaScript. Primitive values (like strings, numbers, booleans) do not have methods themselves. However, when you try to access a property or method on a primitive (e.g., \`"hello".length\`), JavaScript temporarily creates a "wrapper object" of the corresponding type (\`new String("hello")\`), accesses the property on that object, and then discards the object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code \`"hello".toUpperCase()\` demonstrates this.
1. JavaScript sees a property access on a string primitive.
2. It implicitly creates a temporary \`String\` wrapper object: \`new String("hello")\`.
3. It calls the \`.toUpperCase()\` method on this temporary object.
4. The method returns the new string "HELLO".
5. The temporary wrapper object is discarded.

This process is called "autoboxing".

  "symbol-primitive-type": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
\`Symbol\` is a primitive data type introduced in ES6. Its main purpose is to create unique identifiers. Every time you call \`Symbol()\`, you get a new, completely unique value, even if you provide the same description.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Two symbols are created and compared.
\`\`\`javascript
const sym1 = Symbol('description');
const sym2 = Symbol('description');
console.log(sym1 === sym2); // false
\`\`\`
Symbols are often used as keys for object properties that you want to be "hidden" or to avoid naming collisions with other properties.

  "bigint-primitive-type": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The standard \`number\` type in JavaScript cannot safely represent integers larger than \`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER\` (about 9 quadrillion). ES2020 introduced the \`BigInt\` primitive type to work with arbitrarily large integers.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`BigInt\` is created by appending \`n\` to an integer literal or by calling the \`BigInt()\` constructor.
\`\`\`javascript
const veryLargeNumber = 9007199254740991n; // Note the 'n'
const result = veryLargeNumber + 2n;
console.log(result.toString()); // '9007199254740993'

  "var-function-scope-loop-pitfall": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a deeper look at the scope of \`var\`. When \`var\` is used in a \`for\` loop, that variable is not scoped to the loop's block. It is scoped to the entire containing function (or the global scope).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`var\` declared in a loop is accessed after the loop has finished.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    // ...
  }
  // Because 'i' is function-scoped, it still exists here.
  return \`The value of i after the loop is: \${i}\`; // i is 3

  "let-scope-in-catch": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem explores variable shadowing within a \`catch\` block. A \`let\` variable declared inside the \`catch\` block can safely shadow an outer variable of the same name because the \`catch\` block has its own scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An outer \`err\` variable is declared. A \`catch\` block catches an error, and a *new* \`let err\` is declared inside it, which shadows the outer one.
\`\`\`javascript
let err = 'outer';
try {
  throw 'inner';
} catch (e) {
  let err = e; // This is a new 'err' scoped to the catch block
  console.log(\`Inside catch, the new 'err' is "\${err}"\`); // 'inner'
}
console.log(\`Outside, the original 'err' is still "\${err}"\`); // 'outer'

  "hoisting-var-at-global-scope": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about how hoisting works at the very top level of a script. Before any code is executed, the JavaScript engine performs a compilation pass. During this pass, it finds all \`var\` and \`function\` declarations and allocates memory for them in the global scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code \`console.log(x); var x = 5;\` is interpreted by the engine in this order:
1. **Compilation Pass**: See \`var x;\`. Allocate space for \`x\` in the global scope and initialize it to \`undefined\`.
2. **Execution Pass**:
   - Execute \`console.log(x)\`. The value of \`x\` is currently \`undefined\`.
   - Execute the assignment \`x = 5\`. The value of \`x\` is now 5.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Execution Context**: Hoisting is part of the "creation" phase of an execution context.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 82
  "const-primitive-vs-object-deep-dive": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a core concept. \`const\` does not make a value immutable. It creates an immutable *binding*.
- For **primitives**, the value is stored directly in the variable's location. Since the binding is immutable, the value itself cannot be changed.
- For **objects/arrays**, the value stored in the variable is a *reference* (a memory address). \`const\` prevents this reference from being changed, but it does nothing to the object at that memory address, which can still be mutated.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
- \`const x = 10;\` The variable \`x\` is bound to the value 10. You cannot change this binding.
- \`const y = {};\` The variable \`y\` is bound to the memory address of a new object. You cannot change this binding (you can't make \`y\` point to a different object). However, you can access the object via that address and change its properties: \`y.prop = 'new'\`.

  "global-object-conceptual": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the global environment in JavaScript.
- **Global Object**: In any JavaScript environment, there is a global object that contains built-in functions (\`parseInt\`, \`isNaN\`) and, in some cases, global variables.
- **\`window\`**: In web browsers, the global object is named \`window\`. It also represents the browser tab and has many browser-specific APIs.
- **\`global\`**: In Node.js, the global object is named \`global\`.
- **\`globalThis\`**: Because the name of the global object was different across environments, ES2020 introduced \`globalThis\`, which provides a standard, environment-agnostic way to access the global object.

  "typeof-in-tdz": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a strict rule of the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ). Unlike with \`var\` (where \`typeof myVar\` would be \`'undefined'\` before declaration), trying to use *any* operator or function on a \`let\` or \`const\` variable before its declaration line results in a \`ReferenceError\`. This includes \`typeof\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The conceptual code demonstrates this error.
\`\`\`javascript
// TDZ for myLet starts
// typeof myLet; // This line would throw a ReferenceError
let myLet = 5;
\`\`\`
This enforces stricter code by preventing you from interacting with a variable in any way before it has been properly initialized.

  // problem explanation--> 85
  "hoisting-order-var-and-function": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
When the JavaScript engine hoists declarations, it has a clear order of precedence. **Function declarations are hoisted before variable declarations.**

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function and a variable with the same name are declared.
\`\`\`javascript
// During compilation, this is processed as:
// 1. function myThing() { return 'function'; } // Function is hoisted first.
// 2. var myThing; // This is now a duplicate declaration and is ignored.

console.log(typeof myThing); // 'function'
var myThing = 'variable';
console.log(typeof myThing); // 'string'
\`\`\`
The function declaration "wins" the hoisting race. The subsequent \`var\` declaration is effectively ignored, and only the assignment part of that line is executed later.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Hoisting Precedence**: Functions > Variables.

  // problem explanation--> 86
  "hoisting-class-declaration": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
ES6 \`class\` declarations have a similar hoisting behavior to \`let\`. They *are* hoisted (the name is known to the scope), but they remain in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until the declaration line is executed.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt is made to instantiate a class before its declaration.
\`\`\`javascript
// new MyClass(); // Throws a ReferenceError
class MyClass {}
\`\`\`
This behavior prevents certain types of errors and ensures that a class is fully defined before it can be used.

### 📚 Key Concepts

  // problem explanation--> 87
  "object-freeze-nested": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates an important limitation of \`Object.freeze()\`: it is a **shallow** operation. It makes the top-level properties of the object immutable, but if one of those properties is another object, that nested object is *not* frozen.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A nested object is modified after the parent object has been frozen.
\`\`\`javascript
const user = {
  name: 'Alice',
  details: { age: 30 }
};
Object.freeze(user);

// user.name = 'Bob'; // This would fail.
user.details.age = 31; // This succeeds!
\`\`\`
To make an object deeply immutable, you would need to write a recursive function that applies \`Object.freeze()\` to all nested objects.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Shallow vs. Deep Operations**: A common concept in programming. Shallow operations affect only the top level of a data structure, while deep operations recurse into nested structures.

  "object-seal": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
\`Object.seal()\` is another method for controlling object mutability. A sealed object is less restrictive than a frozen one. On a sealed object:
- You **cannot** add new properties.
- You **cannot** delete existing properties.
- You **can** modify the values of existing properties.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An object is sealed, and its existing property is modified.
\`\`\`javascript
const sealedObj = { a: 1 };
Object.seal(sealedObj);

sealedObj.a = 2; // Allowed
// delete sealedObj.a; // Not allowed (fails silently in non-strict mode)

  "destructure-assignment-without-declaration": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
You can use destructuring to assign values to variables that have already been declared. However, when destructuring an object this way, the statement must be wrapped in parentheses.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Variables \`a\` and \`b\` are assigned values from an object.
\`\`\`javascript
let a, b;
// The parentheses are required here
({ a, b } = { a: 1, b: 2 });
\`\`\`
The reason for the parentheses is to disambiguate the code. Without them, the JavaScript parser would see the opening curly brace \`{\` and interpret it as the start of a block statement, not an object literal, which would lead to a \`SyntaxError\`.

- **Syntactic Ambiguity**: A situation where a piece of code can be interpreted in more than one way by the language parser.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 91
  "destructure-dynamic-property-name": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem explores a limitation of destructuring. The destructuring syntax requires static, known property names at author-time. You cannot use a variable to specify which property to extract directly within the destructuring pattern itself.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The conceptual code shows that this is not possible and provides the correct alternative.
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = { name: 'Ivy', role: 'admin' };
const propToGet = 'role';

// This syntax is NOT valid:
// const { [propToGet]: value } = obj; 

// The correct way is to use standard bracket notation:
const value = obj[propToGet]; // 'admin'

  "destructure-mixed-array-object": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Destructuring patterns can be nested to any depth, and can mix and match array and object patterns to precisely extract data from complex, nested structures.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A complex object containing an array is destructured.
\`\`\`javascript
const data = {
  id: 1,
  items: ['apple', { type: 'banana' }]
};

// We want the id and the type of the second item.
const { id, items: [, { type }] } = data;
\`\`\`
Let's break down the pattern \`{ id, items: [, { type }] }\`:
- \`{ id, ... }\`: From the outer object, extract the property \`id\` into a variable \`id\`.
- \`items: [...]\`: Extract the property \`items\`. Instead of assigning it to a variable, apply a nested array destructuring pattern to it.
- \`[, { type }]\`: In the \`items\` array, skip the first element (\`,\`), then for the second element (which is an object), apply another nested object destructuring pattern \`{ type }\` to extract its \`type\` property.

### 📚 Key Concepts

  "shadowing-in-catch-block": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explores the scope of the error parameter in a \`catch\` block. Before ES2019, if an outer variable with the same name as the \`catch\` parameter existed, some complex behaviors could arise. ES2019 standardized the behavior: the \`catch\` parameter *always* creates a new, block-scoped variable that shadows any outer variable.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`e\` in the \`catch\` block is a completely separate variable from the outer \`e\`.
\`\`\`javascript
let e = 'outer';
try {
  throw 'inner';
} catch (e) {
  // This 'e' is block-scoped to the catch block
  console.log(e); // 'inner'
}
console.log(e); // 'outer'
\`\`\`
This behavior is now consistent and predictable.

### 📚 Key Concepts

  // problem explanation--> 94
  "tdz-and-closures": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the interaction between the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) and closures. A closure captures a variable, not its value at the time the closure is created. If the closure is called *before* the variable's declaration line is reached, it will still be subject to the TDZ.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function \`fn\` is created that forms a closure over \`myLet\`. It is then called before \`myLet\` is declared.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  const fn = () => myLet; // Closure captures the 'myLet' variable
  
  // Calling fn() here would throw a ReferenceError
  // because myLet is still in its TDZ.
  
  let myLet = 5;
  
  return fn(); // Calling it here is fine.
}
\`\`\`
The key takeaway is that the TDZ check happens when the variable is *accessed*, not when the closure is *created*.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Closures**: An inner function's reference to its outer scope.
- **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**: The check is performed at access-time.

  "tdz-with-default-params": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Function parameters are evaluated from left to right. This means a parameter can reference a parameter that came before it. However, if it references a parameter that comes *after* it, that second parameter will still be in its Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The default value for parameter \`a\` tries to access \`b\` before \`b\` has been initialized.
\`\`\`javascript
// This function definition is valid
function test(a = b, b = 5) {
  // ...
}

// Calling it with no arguments will cause an error:
// test(); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
\`\`\`
When \`test()\` is called, the engine tries to evaluate the default for \`a\`. It looks for \`b\`, but \`b\` has not been initialized yet (it's in the TDZ of the parameter scope), so a \`ReferenceError\` is thrown.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Parameter Scope**: Function parameters have their own intermediate scope.
- **Left-to-Right Evaluation**: Parameters are initialized in the order they are written.

  "garbage-collection-conceptual": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about how JavaScript manages memory. JavaScript has automatic memory management, performed by a process called a **Garbage Collector (GC)**. The core principle is **reachability**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
- **Allocation**: When you declare a variable or create an object (\`let x = {}\`), memory is allocated.
- **Use**: Your code reads from and writes to this memory (\`x.prop = 5\`).
- **Release (Garbage Collection)**: The GC periodically runs in the background. It starts from a set of "roots" (like the global object) and traverses all references to find all "reachable" objects. Any object that is *not* reachable is considered garbage and the memory it occupies is reclaimed.

An object becomes unreachable when there are no more variables or other objects that have a reference to it (e.g., a local variable goes out of scope and nothing else points to its object).

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Garbage Collection**: The process of automatic memory reclamation.
- **Reachability**: The core concept the GC uses to determine if memory is still in use.

  "memory-leak-with-closures": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A memory leak occurs when a piece of memory is no longer needed by the application but is not released by the garbage collector. Closures are a common source of memory leaks if not managed carefully.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example:
\`\`\`javascript
function createLeakyListener() {
  const largeData = new Array(1000000).fill('*'); // 1. A large variable is created.
  
  // 2. An inner function (closure) is created that uses this variable.
  const listener = () => {
    console.log(largeData[0]); 
  };
  
  // 3. The closure is assigned as an event listener, which is a long-lived reference.
  document.body.addEventListener('click', listener);
}
\`\`\`
Even after \`createLeakyListener\` finishes, the \`listener\` function is still alive (referenced by the DOM). Because the \`listener\` needs access to \`largeData\`, \`largeData\` is kept in memory and will not be garbage collected until the event listener is removed.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Memory Leak**: Unwanted memory retention.
- **Closures**: Can cause leaks by unintentionally keeping references to large objects from outer scopes.

  "let-in-switch-case": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a subtle aspect of scope. The entire \`switch\` statement is considered a single block. Therefore, you cannot declare the same block-scoped variable (\`let\` or \`const\`) in multiple \`case\` clauses without creating sub-blocks, because you would be trying to redeclare it in the same block.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An attempt to declare \`x\` in two different cases.
\`\`\`javascript
switch(1) {
  case 1:
    let x = 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    // let x = 2; // SyntaxError: Identifier 'x' has already been declared

// The fix is to give each case its own block scope:
switch(1) {
  case 1: {
    let x = 1;
    break;
  }
  case 2: {
    let x = 2; // This is now fine

  "tdz-and-function-parameters": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is similar to the default parameters problem but applies to all parameter initializations. The parameters of a function are evaluated from left to right, and each one is in the TDZ until its initializer has been evaluated.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A function is defined where one parameter references another that appears later in the list.
\`\`\`javascript
// This function definition is valid, but calling it can cause an error.
function test(a = b, b) {
  // ...
}

// test(undefined, 5); // This would throw a ReferenceError for 'b'
\`\`\`
When the call happens, the engine tries to set the default value for \`a\`. It looks for \`b\`, but \`b\` has not been initialized yet from the argument list, so it is in the TDZ.

\`\`\`
1. **Freeze Parent**: The function first freezes the object passed to it.
2. **Recurse on Children**: It then iterates over the object's properties. If a property is an object that isn't already frozen, it makes a recursive call to \`deepFreeze\` on that property.

Function parameters have their own scope, separate from the function body, allowing defaults to reference outer scopes but not the body.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Parameters capture outer variables.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = "outer";
function test(xParam = x) {
  let inner = "inner";
  return xParam; // "outer"

  "object-is-for-nan": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates that \`Object.is()\` provides a reliable way to check for \`NaN\` values, unlike the strict equality operator (\`===\`) which fails for \`NaN\` comparisons.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`Object.is(NaN, NaN)\` returns \`true\`, making it the only reliable equality check for \`NaN\` values in JavaScript. This is particularly useful for validation and error handling where \`NaN\` values need to be detected.

\`\`\`javascript
// Traditional NaN check (problematic)
NaN === NaN; // false

// Reliable NaN check with Object.is
Object.is(NaN, NaN); // true

// Alternative reliable methods
Number.isNaN(NaN); // true
isNaN(NaN); // true (but has coercion issues)
\`\`\`

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **\`NaN\` Quirks**: \`NaN\` is the only value in JavaScript that is not equal to itself when using standard equality operators.
- **\`Object.is()\`**: Implements "SameValue" algorithm that correctly handles \`NaN\` comparisons.
- **Use Cases**: Essential for mathematical operations, data validation, and debugging where \`NaN\` values need precise detection.

  // problem explanation--> 117
  "primitive-vs-reference-assignment": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem illustrates a fundamental concept in JavaScript: how values are assigned.
- **Primitives (string, number, etc.)** are passed by **value**. A copy of the value is made.
- **Objects (including arrays)** are passed by **reference** (or more accurately, "copy of a reference"). A copy of the memory address is made.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The code compares the two behaviors.
\`\`\`javascript
// Pass by value
let a = 10;
let b = a; // 'b' gets a copy of the value 10
b = 20;    // 'a' is unaffected

// Pass by reference
let obj1 = { val: 10 };
let obj2 = obj1; // 'obj2' gets a copy of the reference to the object
obj2.val = 20;   // 'obj1' is affected because both variables point to the same object

  // problem explanation--> 118
  "hoisting-pitfall-with-blocks": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a strange behavior in non-strict mode. Function declarations inside blocks (like an \`if\` statement) are supposed to be block-scoped, but for backward compatibility, many browsers also hoist them to the top of the containing function, which can be very confusing.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
In non-strict mode, the behavior can be unpredictable.
\`\`\`javascript
// non-strict mode
if (true) {
  function sayHi() { console.log('Hi'); }
}
// sayHi(); // This might work in some browsers but not others.
\`\`\`
**Best Practice**: Never use function declarations inside blocks. Use function expressions assigned to \`let\` or \`const\` instead. In strict mode, function declarations are properly block-scoped.

  "destructuring-iterable": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
Array destructuring is not limited to arrays. It can be used on any object that implements the **iterable protocol**. This includes strings, arrays, \`Map\`s, and \`Set\`s.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Array destructuring is used on a \`Set\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const mySet = new Set(['a', 'b', 'c']);
const [first, second] = mySet;
// first is 'a'
// second is 'b'
\`\`\`
The destructuring assignment requests the first two values from the set's iterator.

  "const-and-garbage-collection": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. The choice of \`let\` vs. \`const\` has no direct impact on garbage collection. The garbage collector determines if an object is "reachable" from the root of the program (like the global object). If an object is no longer reachable, it can be collected.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Whether a variable is declared with \`let\` or \`const\`, once it goes out of scope and no other references to its object exist, the object becomes eligible for garbage collection.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  const largeObject = { /* ... */ };
  // ...
}
// After test() runs, 'largeObject' goes out of scope. 
// If nothing else refers to the object it pointed to, it can be garbage collected.

  "var-in-eval-scope": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
The \`eval()\` function executes a string of JavaScript code. When \`var\` is used inside an \`eval()\` string, it declares the variable in the scope where \`eval()\` was called. This is generally considered a bad practice and a security risk.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A variable declared in \`eval\` becomes available in the containing function.
\`\`\`javascript
function demo() {
  eval("var hidden = 'I escaped!';");
  // 'hidden' is now a variable in the 'demo' function's scope
  return hidden;

  "let-in-eval-scope": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
In contrast to \`var\`, when you use \`let\` or \`const\` inside an \`eval()\` call, the variable is scoped only to the block created by the \`eval\` execution. It does not "leak" into the surrounding scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`let\` variable declared in \`eval\` is not accessible outside.
\`\`\`javascript
function demo() {
  eval("let secret = 'I am contained.';");
  // console.log(secret); // Throws a ReferenceError
}

  "var-without-window": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about different JavaScript environments. While global \`var\` declarations attach to the \`window\` object in browsers, this is not true in all environments. In Node.js, a top-level \`var\` in a file is scoped to the **module**, not the true global object (\`global\`).

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
- **Node.js Module**:
  \`\`\`javascript
  // in my-module.js
  var moduleVar = 5;
  // console.log(global.moduleVar); // undefined
  \`\`\`
- **Node.js REPL (interactive console)**:
  \`\`\`
  > var replVar = 10;
  > global.replVar // 10

  "destructuring-and-prototypes": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
When you destructure an object, the JavaScript engine looks for properties on the object itself first. If it doesn't find a property, it will then look up the **prototype chain**.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A property from a prototype is successfully destructured.
\`\`\`javascript
const proto = { inherited: 'yes' };
const obj = Object.create(proto); // 'obj' inherits from 'proto'
obj.own = 'no';

const { inherited, own } = obj;
// 'own' is found on obj itself.

  "variable-lifecycle-in-closures": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a key aspect of closures. When an inner function is returned from an outer function, it maintains a reference to its parent's scope. This means that variables from the parent scope are not garbage collected, even after the parent function has finished executing. They "survive" as long as the inner function exists.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`count\` variable persists between calls to the \`counter\` function.
\`\`\`javascript
function outer() {
  let count = 0; // 'count' is created here
  return function inner() {
    count++; // 'inner' has a closure over 'count'
    return count;

  "using-symbols-for-metadata": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A great use case for \`Symbol\` is to add properties to an object that act as "metadata" without the risk of naming collisions. Symbol-keyed properties are also ignored by default by constructs like \`JSON.stringify()\` and \`for...in\` loops, making them ideal for internal data.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A unique symbol is used to attach a private-like ID to an object.
\`\`\`javascript
const idSymbol = Symbol('id');
const user = { name: 'Test' };
user[idSymbol] = 123;

console.log(JSON.stringify(user)); // '{"name":"Test"}' (the symbol is ignored)

  "const-for-math-constants": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a straightforward, practical use case for \`const\`. Mathematical or scientific constants that are used in calculations are perfect candidates for \`const\` because their values should never change.

A constant for PI is declared and used.
\`\`\`javascript
const PI = 3.14159;
const radius = 5;

  "destructure-react-props": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem showing a very common pattern in the React library. React components are functions that receive a single object called \`props\`. It is standard practice to destructure this \`props\` object directly in the function's parameter list to get access to the needed values.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual React component.
\`\`\`javascript
// Instead of this:
// function User(props) {
//   return <div>{props.name}</div>;

  "let-for-cached-value": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a practical use of \`let\` for caching. Caching is a performance optimization where the result of an expensive operation is stored so that it doesn't need to be re-calculated on subsequent calls. The cached value needs to be stored in a variable that can be reassigned.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`let\` variable is used to store a cached result.
\`\`\`javascript
let cachedData = null;
function getData() {
  if (cachedData) {
    return \`(from cache) \${cachedData}\`;
  }
  // Simulate an expensive operation
  cachedData = 'expensive data';
  return \`(calculated) \${cachedData}\`;
}
getData(); // Calculates the data
getData(); // Returns the cached data
\`\`\`
Because \`cachedData\` is reassigned from \`null\` to the actual data, \`let\` is the appropriate choice.

### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem to clarify that destructuring assignment performs a direct value assignment without any automatic type coercion. This is in contrast to constructs like loose equality (\`==\`) or \`if\` statements that do perform coercion.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The string \`"0"\` is destructured.
\`\`\`javascript

  "global-scope-pollution": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a major drawback of overusing global variables. "Polluting the global scope" means declaring too many variables at the global level. This is considered bad practice because:
1.  **Naming Collisions**: Your global variable might have the same name as a variable in a third-party library you're using, causing one to overwrite the other and leading to hard-to-debug errors.
2.  **Code Readability**: It's difficult to track where a global variable is being read from or modified, making the code harder to reason about.

This is a common point of confusion. The statement "\`let\` and \`const\` are not hoisted" is technically incorrect. They *are* hoisted. The JavaScript engine is aware of them at the top of their scope during the compilation phase.

However, unlike \`var\` which is initialized to \`undefined\`, \`let\` and \`const\` are left **uninitialized**. The period where they are hoisted but uninitialized is the **Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)**. Any attempt to access them in the TDZ results in a \`ReferenceError\`.

  "passing-objects-to-functions": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
When you pass an object (including an array) to a function, the "pass-by-sharing" mechanism is used. The function receives a **copy of the reference** (the memory address) to the object. Because both the original variable and the function's parameter point to the *same* object in memory, modifying the object's properties inside the function will affect the original object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
An object's property is modified inside a function.
\`\`\`javascript
let myObj = { val: 10 };
function modify(obj) {
  // 'obj' points to the same object as 'myObj'
  obj.val = 20;

  "reassigning-object-param": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This clarifies a common point of confusion with "pass-by-reference." While you can *mutate* the object a parameter refers to, you cannot change the original external variable by *reassigning* the parameter inside the function. Reassigning the parameter just makes it point to a new object, breaking its link to the original one.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The function's parameter is reassigned to a new object.
\`\`\`javascript
let myObj = { val: 10 };
function reassign(obj) {
  // This makes the local 'obj' parameter point to a brand new object.
  // It does not affect the original 'myObj' variable.
  obj = { val: 20 };
}
reassign(myObj);
// myObj is still { val: 10 }

  "hoisting-in-eval": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a complex and often undesirable interaction. Code inside an \`eval()\` string is executed within the scope where \`eval\` is called. A \`var\` declaration inside the evaluated string will be hoisted to the top of that containing scope.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`var x\` is hoisted from the \`eval\` string.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  eval("console.log(x); var x = 5;"); // logs 'undefined'
}
\`\`\`
This happens because the \`var x\` is hoisted within the \`test\` function's scope. This behavior is another reason why \`eval\` is generally avoided.

  "const-enum-pattern": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript does not have a built-in \`enum\` type like some other languages. A common pattern to create a safe, simple enumeration is to use a plain object, declared with \`const\`, and then freeze it with \`Object.freeze()\`.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A \`STATUS\` enum is created.
\`\`\`javascript
const STATUS = Object.freeze({
  PENDING: 'pending',
  COMPLETE: 'complete',

This problem combines three powerful destructuring features: extracting a property, renaming it (aliasing), and collecting all other properties into a new object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`id\` property is extracted and renamed to \`userID\`, and the rest are collected.
\`\`\`javascript
const user = { id: 99, name: 'Zoe', active: true };
const { id: userID, ...otherInfo } = user;
// userID is 99
// otherInfo is { name: 'Zoe', active: true }
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Composability**: Destructuring features can be combined in a single expression for powerful data extraction.

  "global-scope-without-window": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the global scope in a Web Worker. A Web Worker runs in a separate thread from the main browser UI thread. As such, it has its own, distinct global scope. It does not have access to the main thread's \`window\` object or the DOM.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
In a worker script:
\`\`\`javascript
// inside worker.js
console.log(self); // Logs the WorkerGlobalScope
console.log(self === this); // true
// console.log(window); // ReferenceError: window is not defined
\`\`\`
The global scope in a worker is referenced by the keyword \`self\`.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Web Workers**: Provide a multi-threaded environment in the browser.
- **\`WorkerGlobalScope\`**: The name of the global scope object inside a worker.

  "scope-of-default-parameters": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is an advanced scope concept. The default values of function parameters are evaluated in an **intermediate scope** that exists between the scope where the function is defined and the scope of the function's body.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A default parameter captures the global \`x\`.
\`\`\`javascript
let x = 'global';
function test(a = x) { // 'a' is evaluated. It looks for 'x' and finds the global one.
  let x = 'inner'; // This 'x' is in the function body's scope.
  return a; // Returns the value captured by the parameter, which was 'global'.
}
test(); // returns 'global'
\`\`\`
### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Parameter Scope**: A special, intermediate scope for evaluating default parameter values.

  // problem explanation--> 150
  "automatic-semicolon-insertion": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
JavaScript has a feature called Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI) where the parser automatically inserts semicolons at the end of lines if they are missing. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially with the \`return\` statement.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A newline after \`return\` causes a semicolon to be inserted.
\`\`\`javascript
function test() {
  return // <-- ASI inserts a semicolon here!
  {
    value: 1 // This becomes unreachable code.
  }
}
test(); // returns undefined
\`\`\`
The code is interpreted as \`return;\`, and the function returns \`undefined\` before the object literal is ever reached.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **ASI (Automatic Semicolon Insertion)**: A JavaScript feature that can sometimes lead to bugs. It's a key reason why opening curly braces are conventionally placed on the same line.

  "object-is-vs-triple-equals": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights the subtle but important differences between \`Object.is()\` and the strict equality operator (\`===\`), specifically regarding \`NaN\` values and signed zeros.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
While \`Object.is()\` behaves identically to \`===\` for most values, it differs in two critical edge cases:

\`\`\`javascript
// NaN comparison
NaN === NaN;    // false (problematic)
Object.is(NaN, NaN); // true (correct)

// Signed zero comparison
0 === -0;       // true (hides distinction)
Object.is(0, -0);    // false (preserves distinction)
\`\`\`

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **SameValue vs Strict Equality**: \`Object.is()\` implements the "SameValue" algorithm defined in the ECMAScript specification.
- **\`NaN\` Handling**: \`Object.is()\` correctly identifies that two \`NaN\` values represent the same invalid number concept.
- **Signed Zeros**: JavaScript distinguishes between positive zero (\`+0\`) and negative zero (\`-0\`), and \`Object.is()\` preserves this distinction while \`===\` does not.
- **Practical Use**: Use \`Object.is()\` when you need precise value identity checking, particularly in mathematical computations and library implementations where these edge cases matter.
`,
  // problem explanation--> 152
  "global-let-in-modules": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the scope of variables in ES Modules. Unlike classic scripts, ES modules have their own top-level scope. A variable declared with \`let\`, \`const\`, or even \`var\` at the top level of a module is **local to that module**. It does not become a global variable accessible in other modules or on the \`window\` object.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
- **\`moduleA.js\`**: \`let x = 10;\`
- **\`moduleB.js\`**: \`import './moduleA.js'; console.log(x); // ReferenceError\`

The variable \`x\` is private to \`moduleA.js\` unless it is explicitly exported (\`export let x = 10;\`) and imported.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Module Scope**: A key feature of ES Modules that provides strong encapsulation and prevents global scope pollution.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 153
  "destructure-from-generator": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
A generator function, when called, returns an iterator object. This iterator object is an **iterable**, which means it can be used with array destructuring.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Values are destructured from a generator's iterator.
\`\`\`javascript
function* myGen() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
}
const [a, b] = myGen();
// 'a' is 1, 'b' is 2
\`\`\`
The destructuring assignment will call the iterator's \`.next()\` method as many times as there are variables in the pattern, assigning the \`value\` from each result.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Generators and Iterables**: Generators provide a simple way to create iterable objects.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 154
  "immutable-array-push": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a core pattern of immutable programming. Instead of mutating an array by calling \`.push()\`, you create a **new** array that contains all the elements of the original, plus the new element. The spread syntax (\`...\`) makes this very clean.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
A new array is created with an added element.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = [1, 2];
const updated = [...original, 3];
// original is still [1, 2]
// updated is [1, 2, 3]
\`\`\`

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Immutability**: The practice of not changing data structures, but instead creating new ones with the updated data.
- **Spread Syntax**: A concise way to copy array elements into a new array.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 155
  "immutable-array-pop": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how to perform an immutable "pop" operation on an array. The goal is to create a new array that is identical to the original except without the last element, leaving the original array unchanged. This is a common pattern in functional programming and state management systems.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
The \`.slice()\` method is used to create a shallow copy of the array up to the second-to-last element.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = [1, 2, 3];
const updated = original.slice(0, -1);
// original is still [1, 2, 3]
// updated is [1, 2]
\`\`\`
The arguments to \`.slice(0, -1)\` mean "start from index 0 and end at the index that is 1 before the last element."

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Immutability**: Avoiding direct modifications to data structures to make code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **\`.slice()\`**: A non-mutating array method that returns a new array containing a portion of the original.
`,
  // problem explanation--> 156
  "immutable-object-delete": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows a modern, immutable pattern for "deleting" a property from an object. Instead of using the \`delete\` operator (which mutates the object), you create a new object that contains all properties *except* the one you want to remove.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
Object destructuring and the rest syntax are combined for this.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };
const { b, ...rest } = original;
// New object is missing 'b': { a: 1, c: 3 }
\`\`\`
The \`b\` property is destructured out, and the remaining properties are collected into a new object using the rest syntax.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Rest Properties**: Using \`...\` to collect remaining object properties
- **Immutable Update**: Creating new objects instead of mutating existing ones
`,

  // problem explanation--> 157
  "with-statement-conceptual": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains the deprecated \`with\` statement, which was used to extend the scope chain but caused significant performance and predictability issues.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
// Deprecated syntax - do not use
with (Math) {
  console.log(PI, cos(PI));
}
\`\`\`
The \`with\` statement adds an object to the scope chain, making its properties available as local variables.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Scope Chain Pollution**: \`with\` modifies the scope chain dynamically
- **Performance Issues**: Prevents JavaScript engine optimizations
- **Strict Mode**: \`with\` is forbidden in strict mode

  // problem explanation--> 158
  "let-in-switch-fallthrough": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates how \`let\` declarations in \`switch\` statements work with case fallthrough and the Temporal Dead Zone.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
switch (1) {
  case 1:
    let x = 1; // TDZ starts
    break;
  case 2:
    // console.log(x); // ReferenceError: x is in TDZ
    break;
}
\`\`\`
Each \`case\` doesn't create a new block scope, so \`let\` declarations are visible to subsequent cases.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Switch Scope**: The entire \`switch\` is one block scope
- **TDZ in Switch**: Variables declared with \`let\` are in TDZ until declared
`,

  // problem explanation--> 159
  "destructuring-and-getters": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown

const obj = {
  get value() {
    console.log('Getter called');
    return 42;
  }
};
const { value } = obj; // Logs "Getter called"
\`\`\`

'use strict';
if (true) {
  function blockScoped() {
    return "I'm block-scoped in strict mode";
  }
}
// blockScoped(); // ReferenceError in strict mode
\`\`\`
In strict mode, function declarations are block-scoped like let/const variables.

const obj = { value: 1 };
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'value', {
  value: 2,
  writable: false
});
// obj.value is now 2 and cannot be changed
\`\`\`
const protects the variable binding, not the object's mutability.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const users = [{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }];
Object.freeze(users);
users[0].name = 'Eve'; // This works - freeze is shallow
// users.push({}) would fail
\`\`\`
Only the array structure is frozen, not the objects it contains.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Shallow Freeze**: Object.freeze doesn't recurse into nested objects
- **Deep Freeze Pattern**: Need custom function for complete immutability

This explains that property access during destructuring happens in source object order.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = {
  get a() { console.log('a'); return 1; },
  get b() { console.log('b'); return 2; }
};
const { b, a } = obj; // Logs 'a' then 'b'
\`\`\`
Properties are accessed in the order they exist in the source object, not the destructuring pattern.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Property Order**: Access follows source object enumeration order
- **Getter Invocation**: Getters are called during destructuring
- **Side Effects**: Destructuring can have observable side effects

  "global-var-and-delete": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows that global var declarations create non-configurable properties that can't be deleted.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
var globalVar = 1;
delete window.globalVar; // false - cannot delete

window.globalProp = 2;
delete window.globalProp; // true - can delete
\`\`\`
var declarations in global scope create non-configurable properties.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Property Attributes**: var creates non-configurable properties
- **Delete Operator**: Only works on configurable properties
- **Global Object**: var adds properties to global object (window in browsers)

  "tdz-and-recursion": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates Temporal Dead Zone issues with recursive function references.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const factorial = (n) => {
  if (n === 0) return 1;
  return n * factorial(n - 1); // ReferenceError in TDZ
};
\`\`\`
A function expression can't reference itself in its initializer due to TDZ.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Recursive Functions**: Function expressions can't reference themselves immediately
- **TDZ Limitations**: Variables can't be used in their own initializers
- **Named Function Workaround**: Named function expressions can reference themselves

  "const-assertions-typescript": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains TypeScript's const assertions which create deeply readonly types.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`typescript
// TypeScript example
const arr = [1, 2, 3] as const;
// arr is readonly [1, 2, 3] - elements can't be modified
\`\`\`
const assertions tell TypeScript to infer the most specific literal type.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Type Narrowing**: const assertions narrow types to literals
- **Readonly Types**: Creates deeply immutable type structures
- **TypeScript Feature**: Specific to TypeScript, not JavaScript

  "scope-in-generator-functions": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains how variable scoping works in generator functions across yields.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
function* generator() {
  let count = 0;
  while (true) {
    yield count++;
  }
}
const gen = generator();
gen.next(); // { value: 0, done: false }
gen.next(); // { value: 1, done: false }
\`\`\`
Generator functions maintain their variable state across yield statements.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Generator State**: Local variables persist between yields
- **Execution Suspension**: Generators can pause and resume execution
- **Closure Preservation**: Generator closures are maintained across yields

  "destructuring-invalid-identifiers": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows how to destructure properties with names that aren't valid JavaScript identifiers.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const obj = { 'invalid-identifier': 42 };
const { 'invalid-identifier': validName } = obj;
// validName = 42
\`\`\`
You can destructure invalid identifiers by quoting them and providing a valid alias.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Property Names**: JavaScript allows various string values as property names
- **Identifier Rules**: Variable names have different rules than property names
- **Aliasing**: Mapping invalid identifiers to valid variable names

  "var-hoisting-conditional-function": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains the historical inconsistent behavior of function declarations in blocks.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
if (true) {
  function conditional() { return 'I behave differently in different browsers'; }
}
\`\`\`
Older browsers had different behaviors for function declarations in blocks.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Historical Inconsistency**: Different browsers implemented this differently
- **Strict Mode**: ES5 strict mode standardized the behavior
- **Legacy Code**: Older code may rely on specific browser behaviors

  "let-and-const-with-proxy-traps": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows that Proxy traps respect the Temporal Dead Zone for let and const.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const proxy = new Proxy({}, {
  get(target, prop) {
    // This would throw if prop is in TDZ
    return target[prop];
  }
});

// let x = proxy.someProperty; // Could cause TDZ error
\`\`\`
Proxy traps can't access variables that are in the Temporal Dead Zone.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **TDZ Enforcement**: Proxies respect the Temporal Dead Zone
- **Trap Limitations**: Some operations can't be intercepted due to TDZ
- **Security Implications**: TDZ prevents some meta-programming patterns

  "immutable-update-structuredclone": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This introduces the structuredClone() API for deep copying objects immutably.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const original = { nested: { value: 1 } };
const copy = structuredClone(original);
copy.nested.value = 2; // Does not affect original
\`\`\`
structuredClone() creates a deep copy that can be safely mutated.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Deep Copying**: structuredClone() recursively copies objects
- **Immutable Updates**: Safe pattern for updating nested data
- **Browser API**: Modern browser feature (Node.js has similar utilities)

  "shadowing-with-with-statement": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains how the deprecated with statement can cause unexpected variable shadowing.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const x = 1;
const obj = { x: 2 };

with (obj) {
  console.log(x); // 2 - obj.x shadows outer x
}
\`\`\`
The with statement adds an object's properties to the scope chain, causing shadowing.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **With Statement**: Deprecated feature that modifies scope chain
- **Unpredictable Shadowing**: Hard to predict which variable will be accessed
- **Performance Issues**: with prevents many JavaScript optimizations

  // problem explanation--> 196
  "destructuring-empty-source": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows the behavior of destructuring when the source is empty or doesn't have expected properties.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const [a = 1] = []; // a = 1 (default used)
const { b = 2 } = {}; // b = 2 (default used)
const { c } = null; // TypeError
\`\`\`
Destructuring handles empty sources gracefully with defaults, but null/undefined cause errors.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Empty Values**: Arrays/objects without expected properties
- **Default Values**: Used when property doesn't exist
- **Null Sources**: Destructuring null/undefined throws errors
`,

  // problem explanation--> 197
  "scope-of-class-fields": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains how class fields are scoped and initialized in modern JavaScript classes.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
class Example {
  instanceField = 'per instance';
  static staticField = 'per class';
}
\`\`\`
Instance fields are created per instance, static fields are created per class.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Instance Fields**: Each instance gets its own copy
- **Static Fields**: Shared across all instances
- **Field Initialization**: Happens at object construction time
`,

  // problem explanation--> 198
  "var-in-nodejs-repl": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This explains the special behavior of var in Node.js REPL vs Node.js modules.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
// In Node.js REPL:
var x = 1;
global.x; // 1 - var creates global properties in REPL

// In Node.js module:
var y = 2;
global.y; // undefined - var is module-scoped in files
\`\`\`
Node.js REPL behaves differently from Node.js modules for historical reasons.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **REPL vs Modules**: Different scoping rules in different environments
- **Global Pollution**: var in REPL pollutes global object
- **Module Scope**: var in modules is scoped to the module

  // problem explanation--> 199
  "destructuring-and-symbols": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This shows how to destructure properties keyed by Symbols.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
const sym = Symbol('key');
const obj = { [sym]: 'value' };
const { [sym]: value } = obj; // value = 'value'
\`\`\`
You can destructure Symbol-keyed properties using computed property syntax.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Symbol Properties**: Properties keyed by Symbols
- **Computed Property Names**: Required for Symbol keys in destructuring
- **Unique Keys**: Symbols create unique property keys

  "var-vs-let-vs-const-summary": `
### 💡 Problem Breakdown
This provides a comprehensive summary of the differences between var, let, and const.

### ⚙️ Solution Walkthrough
\`\`\`javascript
// var - function-scoped, hoisted, can be redeclared
var x = 1;
var x = 2; // No error

// let - block-scoped, TDZ, no redeclaration
let y = 1;
// let y = 2; // SyntaxError

// const - block-scoped, must be initialized, no reassignment
const z = 1;
// z = 2; // TypeError
\`\`\`
Each declaration type has different scoping, hoisting, and mutability characteristics.

### 📚 Key Concepts
- **Scoping Differences**: function vs block scope
- **Hoisting Behavior**: var vs let/const hoisting
- **Mutability**: const vs let/var reassignment rules
- **Modern Best Practices**: Prefer const, then let, avoid var
