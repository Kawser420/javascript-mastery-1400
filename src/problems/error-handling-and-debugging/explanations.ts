  "ehd-try-catch-basic": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the most fundamental error handling mechanism in JavaScript. The goal is to execute code that might fail (the \`try\` block) and, if it does, run a separate piece of code to handle the failure (the \`catch\` block) without crashing the program.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`throw\` keyword is used to intentionally create an error. The \`try...catch\` statement intercepts it.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  // Code that might cause an error goes here.
  throw new Error("Something went wrong!");
} catch (e) {
  // This block runs only if an error is thrown in the 'try' block.
  // The 'e' variable contains the error object.
  return \`Caught an error: \${e.message}\`;
}
\`\`\`
1.  **\`try\` block**: The code inside is executed first.
2.  **\`throw new Error(...)\`**: Creates an \`Error\` object and immediately stops execution of the \`try\` block, passing control to the \`catch\` block.
3.  **\`catch (e)\` block**: This block catches the thrown error. The error object is assigned to the variable \`e\`. We can then access its properties, like \`.message\`, to get details.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`try...catch\` statement**: The primary synchronous error handling construct.
- **\`throw\` statement**: Used to create a user-defined exception.
- **\`Error\` object**: The standard built-in object for representing errors.

  "ehd-reference-error": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A \`ReferenceError\` is a specific type of error that occurs when you try to use a variable that has not been declared. The task is to write code that triggers this error and catches it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Accessing an undeclared variable inside a \`try\` block will throw a \`ReferenceError\`.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  // 'undeclaredVariable' has not been defined with let, const, or var.
  const value = undeclaredVariable; 
} catch (e) {
  // 'e.name' will be "ReferenceError"
  return \`Caught a \${e.name}: \${e.message}\`;
}
\`\`\`
This type of error is common when you have a typo in a variable name or forget to declare it.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`ReferenceError\`**: A specific error type indicating an invalid reference.
- **Scope**: Errors like this are related to variable scope and declaration.

  "ehd-type-error": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A \`TypeError\` occurs when an operation is performed on a value of an inappropriate type. A very common example is trying to access a property or call a method on \`null\` or \`undefined\`. The task is to trigger and catch this error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Attempting to call \`.toUpperCase()\` on a \`null\` value will throw a \`TypeError\`.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  const val = null;
  val.toUpperCase(); // This is the line that causes the error.
} catch (e) {
  // 'e.name' will be "TypeError"
  return \`Caught a \${e.name}: \${e.message}\`;
}

  // problem explanation--> 04
  "ehd-throw-string": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`throw\` statement can be used to throw any value, including primitives like strings or numbers. The task is to throw a string and catch it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A string literal is thrown and caught.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  throw "This is just a string error.";
} catch (e) {
  // The caught value 'e' is the string itself.
  // It does not have .name or .message properties.
  return \`Caught a value of type '\${typeof e}': \${e}\`;
}
\`\`\`
**Note**: This is generally considered bad practice. It's always better to throw an actual \`Error\` object, as it contains more information (like a stack trace) which is crucial for debugging.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`throw\` statement**: Can throw any expression.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 05
  "ehd-throw-error-object": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the standard and recommended way to signal an error. The task is to create a new instance of the built-in \`Error\` object and throw it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`new Error()\` constructor is used to create an error object.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  throw new Error("This is a proper error object.");
} catch (e) {
  // 'e' is an object with useful properties.
  return \`Caught Error. Name: \${e.name}, Message: \${e.message}\`;
}
\`\`\`
Creating an \`Error\` object captures the current call stack, which provides a "stack trace" for debugging, showing where the error originated. This is a key advantage over throwing a simple string.

  // problem explanation--> 06
  "ehd-try-catch-finally": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The \`finally\` block is an optional part of a \`try...catch\` statement. The code inside a \`finally\` block is **always** executed after the \`try\` and \`catch\` blocks, regardless of whether an error was thrown or caught. It's used for cleanup code that must run, such as closing a file or a network connection.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The code demonstrates a case where no error occurs.
\`\`\`javascript
let status = "started";
try {
  status += " -> try";
  // No error is thrown.
} catch (e) {
  // The catch block is skipped.
  status += " -> catch";
} finally {
  // The finally block always runs.
  status += " -> finally";

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`finally\` block**: Guarantees execution of cleanup code.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 07
  "ehd-finally-after-return": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a key behavior of the \`finally\` block: it executes even if a \`return\` statement is encountered in the \`try\` or \`catch\` block. The \`finally\` block runs just before control is passed back to the calling code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A function has a \`return\` in the \`try\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
let status = "started";
const run = () => {
  try {
    status += " -> try";
    return " -> returning from try"; // The return is prepared.
  } finally {
    // This block runs *before* the function actually returns.
    status += " -> finally";
  }
};
run(); // The function's return value is discarded, but status is updated.
// The final status is "started -> try -> finally"
\`\`\`
If the \`finally\` block also has a \`return\` statement, its return value will override the one from the \`try\` or \`catch\` block.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Execution Order**: \`finally\` runs after \`try\`/\`catch\` but before a \`return\` from those blocks completes.

  // problem explanation--> 08
  "ehd-custom-error-class": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
You can create your own custom error types for your application. This is a good practice for making error handling more specific and meaningful. The standard way to do this is by creating a class that extends the built-in \`Error\` class.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`ValidationError\` class is created.
\`\`\`javascript
class ValidationError extends Error {
  constructor(message) {
    super(message); // Call the parent Error constructor
    this.name = "ValidationError"; // Set the custom name
  }
}
try {
  throw new ValidationError("Invalid user input.");
} catch (e) {
  // We can see the custom name in the caught error.
  return \`Caught a custom error. Name: \${e.name}, Message: \${e.message}\`;
}
\`\`\`
1.  **\`extends Error\`**: Sets up the prototype chain so our class inherits from \`Error\`.
2.  **\`super(message)\`**: Calls the constructor of the parent \`Error\` class to correctly set the \`message\` property.
3.  **\`this.name = ...\`**: It's a convention to set the \`name\` property to the name of the custom class.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Class Inheritance**: Extending built-in classes to create custom types.
`,

  // problem explanation--> 09
  "ehd-instanceof-error": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Once you have custom error types, you can use the \`instanceof\` operator in a \`catch\` block to perform different actions based on the specific type of error that was caught.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`catch\` block uses an \`if\` statement with \`instanceof\` to check the error type.
\`\`\`javascript
class ValidationError extends Error { /* ... */ }

try {
  throw new ValidationError("Invalid input.");
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof ValidationError) {
    // Handle this specific error type
    return "Handled a specific ValidationError.";

The \`JSON.parse()\` function is used to parse a JSON string. If the string is not valid JSON, it will throw a \`SyntaxError\`. This is a common operation that requires error handling.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`try...catch\` block is wrapped around the \`JSON.parse()\` call.
\`\`\`javascript
function parseJson(jsonString) {
  try {
    JSON.parse(jsonString);

  "ehd-optional-chaining-for-safety": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Optional chaining (\`?.\`) is a modern (ES2020) feature that provides a concise and safe way to access deeply nested object properties. If a reference in the chain is \`null\` or \`undefined\`, the expression "short-circuits" and returns \`undefined\` instead of throwing a \`TypeError\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Optional chaining is used to access a property on a \`null\` value.

  "ehd-error-in-event-listener": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the asynchronous nature of event handlers. When an event (like a click) happens, its callback function is added to the macrotask queue and executed in a new turn of the event loop. The original \`try...catch\` block that *set up* the listener is no longer on the call stack and cannot catch an error that happens inside the callback.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough

  "ehd-throw-in-finally": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This demonstrates a tricky situation. If an error is thrown from a \`finally\` block, it will "mask" or "swallow" any error that might have already been thrown from the \`try\` or \`catch\` block. The program will proceed with the new error from the \`finally\` block.

  "ehd-fetch-error-handling": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A common pitfall with the \`fetch\` API is that it only rejects its promise on a network failure (e.g., DNS error, no internet connection). It does **not** reject on HTTP error statuses like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error). You must check for these manually.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The \`response.ok\` property is checked to determine if the request was successful.
\`\`\`javascript
async function checkStatus(url) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    // 'response.ok' is true for status codes in the 200-299 range.
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(\`HTTP error! status: \${response.status}\`);

  "ehd-unhandled-rejection-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An "unhandled promise rejection" is an error that occurs when a promise is rejected, but there are no \`.catch()\` handlers attached to it to deal with the error. In modern browsers and Node.js, this will typically log a warning or error to the console and may even terminate a Node.js process in the future.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A promise is rejected with no handler.
\`\`\`javascript
// This will cause an unhandled rejection warning in the console.
Promise.reject("This error is not handled.");
\`\`\`
**Rule of Thumb**: Every promise chain should end with a \`.catch()\` handler to ensure all potential errors are dealt with gracefully.

### üìö Key Concepts

  // problem explanation--> 33
  "ehd-async-error-propagation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Errors propagate naturally through \`async/await\` chains. If you \`await\` a function that throws an error (or returns a rejected promise), the \`await\` expression itself will throw that error, which can then be caught by a \`try...catch\` block in the calling function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An \`inner\` function throws an error, which is caught by the \`outer\` function.
\`\`\`javascript
async function inner() {
  throw new Error("Inner error");
}

async function outer() {
  try {
    await inner();
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Caught in outer:", e.message); // "Caught in outer: Inner error"
  }
}
\`\`\`
This shows that you don't need to put a \`try...catch\` block in every single async function; you can often handle errors at a higher level.

  "ehd-debugging-mutation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a common source of bugs: a function that unintentionally modifies an object that was passed to it (an "unintended side effect"). Because objects are passed by reference, this mutation affects the original object in the calling code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The buggy function directly changes a property on the object it receives.
\`\`\`javascript
const original = { value: 10 };
// BUGGY: Mutates the input
function process(obj) { obj.value = 99; }
process(original);

  "ehd-debugging-this-context": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common bug. When you pass a class method as a callback (e.g., to an event listener or \`setTimeout\`), its connection to the class instance is lost. When the callback is executed, \`this\` will not refer to the instance, causing an error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Two modern solutions are presented:
1. **\`.bind()\` in Constructor**:
   \`\`\`javascript
   class MyClass {
     constructor() { this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this); }
     handleClick() { console.log(this); }
   }
   \`\`\`
2. **Arrow Function as Class Field**:
   \`\`\`javascript
   class MyClass {
     handleClick = () => { console.log(this); }
   }
   \`\`\`
The arrow function field is often preferred for its conciseness. It creates a function where \`this\` is permanently bound to the instance.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about an advanced design pattern for building resilient applications. A **Circuit Breaker** is a state machine that wraps a protected operation (like an API call).
- **Closed**: The initial state. Requests are allowed to pass through. If failures exceed a threshold, it trips to the "Open" state.
- **Open**: For a set timeout period, all requests fail immediately without even attempting the operation. This prevents overwhelming a struggling service.
- **Half-Open**: After the timeout, it allows one test request to go through. If it succeeds, the circuit closes. If it fails, it opens again.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about cancelling asynchronous operations. The \`AbortController\` API provides a standard way to do this for APIs that support it, like \`fetch\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The process involves three steps:
1. Create a controller: \`const controller = new AbortController();\`
2. Pass its signal to \`fetch\`: \`fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });\`
3. Call \`controller.abort()\` when you want to cancel. This will cause the \`fetch\` promise to reject with a \`DOMException\` named \`AbortError\`.

  "ehd-type-guard-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a TypeScript feature. A **type guard** is a special function whose return type is a "type predicate" (\`pet is Fish\`). Inside any conditional block that uses this function, TypeScript will narrow the type of the variable to the one specified in the predicate.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A type guard function checks for a specific property.
\`\`\`typescript
interface Fish { swim: () => void; }
interface Bird { fly: () => void; }

  "ehd-never-type-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about TypeScript's \`never\` type. The \`never\` type represents the type of values that never occur. Its main use case is for **exhaustive checking**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
In a \`switch\` statement, you can have a \`default\` case that assigns the variable to a variable of type \`never\`. If you later add a new member to your union type but forget to add a \`case\` for it, the \`default\` block will be reachable, and you'll get a compile-time error because you're trying to assign a real type to \`never\`.
\`\`\`typescript
type Shape = "circle" | "square";
function area(s: Shape) {
  switch (s) {
    case "circle": return ...;
    case "square": return ...;
    default:

  "ehd-debugging-regex": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common bug when writing regular expressions. A regex will match a substring anywhere within a string unless you "anchor" it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The problem regex is missing start and end anchors.
- **Buggy**: \`/#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})/i\` will match "My color is #fff today".
- **Fixed**: \`/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/i\` will only match strings that are *entirely* a hex code, like "#ffffff".

  "ehd-performance-profiling-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a crucial debugging skill: performance profiling. When an application is slow, a **profiler** is a tool used to analyze the performance of your code to find "bottlenecks" ‚Äì the parts of the code that are taking the most time to execute.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The "Performance" or "Profiler" tab in browser developer tools is used for this. The process is:
1.  **Start Recording**: Begin a new profiling session.
2.  **Perform Action**: Interact with the part of your web page that is slow.
3.  **Stop Recording**: Stop the profiler.
4.  **Analyze**: The profiler will display a "flame graph" or a call tree. This is a visualization that shows which functions were running and for how long. Functions that appear as wide bars in the flame graph are taking up a significant amount of time and are the primary candidates for optimization.

  "ehd-memory-leak-debugging-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about debugging memory leaks. A memory leak occurs when your program allocates memory that it no longer needs, but fails to release it, causing the application's memory usage to grow over time and eventually crash.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The "Memory" tab in browser developer tools is the primary tool for this. The "Heap Snapshot" technique is most common:
1.  **Take a Baseline Snapshot**: Load your page and take a heap snapshot. This is a picture of all the objects currently in memory.
2.  **Perform Action**: Interact with your application in a way you suspect is causing a leak (e.g., open and close a modal window several times).
3.  **Take a Second Snapshot**: Take another heap snapshot.
4.  **Compare**: The dev tools can compare the two snapshots. You can look for objects that were created between the snapshots but have not been "garbage collected." A large number of "detached DOM nodes" is a common sign of a memory leak in web applications.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Memory Leak**: Unwanted memory retention.

  "ehd-structured-logging-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a best practice for logging. Instead of logging simple, unstructured strings, **structured logging** involves logging data in a consistent, machine-readable format, typically JSON.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A comparison between unstructured and structured logging.
- **Unstructured**: \`console.log("User 123 logged in successfully.");\`
- **Structured**: 
\`\`\`javascript
console.log(JSON.stringify({
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  level: 'info',
  message: 'User logged in successfully',
  userId: 123,
  source: 'auth-service'
}));
\`\`\`
**Benefits**: Structured logs can be easily collected, parsed, indexed, and searched by log management systems (like Datadog, Splunk, or the ELK stack). This makes it vastly easier to query for specific events, trace a user's journey, or create alerts in a production environment.

### üìö Key Concepts

  "ehd-sentry-integration-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about using third-party services for error monitoring. Services like Sentry, Bugsnag, or Rollbar automate the process of capturing, aggregating, and alerting on errors that occur in your application in a production environment.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The integration process typically involves:
1.  **Sign Up**: Create an account with the service.
2.  **Install SDK**: Add their Software Development Kit (SDK) to your application (e.g., via a script tag or npm package).
3.  **Initialize**: Initialize the SDK with your project-specific key (DSN).
\`\`\`javascript
Sentry.init({ dsn: 'YOUR_DSN_HERE' });
\`\`\`
The SDK then automatically hooks into global error handlers (\`window.onerror\`, \`window.onunhandledrejection\`). When an error occurs, the SDK captures it, gathers context (like the user's browser, OS, URL, and sometimes even the preceding user actions), and sends this rich report to the service's dashboard for you to analyze.

  "ehd-fail-safe-default-value": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a defensive programming pattern. When parsing data that might be invalid (like user input or a configuration file), instead of letting a parsing error crash the application, you can catch the error and return a "fail-safe" default value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`try...catch\` block is used to provide a default configuration object if JSON parsing fails.
\`\`\`javascript
function getConfig(jsonString) {
  try {
    return JSON.parse(jsonString);
  } catch (e) {
    // If parsing fails, log the error and return a safe default.
    console.warn("Could not parse config, using default:", e);
    return { theme: 'default', features: [] };
  }
}
\`\`\`
This makes the application more resilient. It can continue to function with a basic configuration even if the user-provided one is malformed.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Resilience**: Designing applications that can gracefully handle errors and continue to operate.
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Providing a known, safe state to fall back to in case of an error.

  "ehd-top-level-await-rejection": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a modern ES module feature. Top-level \`await\` allows you to use the \`await\` keyword at the top level of a module. If a promise that is awaited at the top level rejects, it blocks the execution of the current module and any other modules that depend on it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of how the error propagates.
- **\`moduleA.js\`**:
\`\`\`javascript
// This rejection will be unhandled
await Promise.reject('Module A failed to initialize');
export const config = {};
\`\`\`
- **\`main.js\`**:
\`\`\`javascript
import { config } from './moduleA.js';
// This line will never be reached, because the import of moduleA failed.
console.log('Main module started');
\`\`\`
The unhandled rejection in \`moduleA\` effectively prevents \`main.js\` from ever executing.

  "ehd-finally-and-async-return": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem explores the interaction between \`return\` statements in \`try\` and \`finally\` blocks within an \`async\` function. The rule is the same as for synchronous functions: a \`return\` statement in a \`finally\` block will **override** any \`return\` statement in the corresponding \`try\` or \`catch\` block.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An \`async\` function has a \`return\` in both \`try\` and \`finally\`.
\`\`\`javascript
async function test() {
  try {
    return "try"; // This return is prepared...
  } finally {
    // ...but this return statement takes precedence and is the actual return value.

An **assertion** is a statement that a condition must be true at a certain point in a program. It's a debugging tool used to check for "impossible" conditions. If an assertion fails, it indicates a serious bug in the program logic. The task is to create a simple \`assert\` function.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The function takes a condition and a message. If the condition is falsy, it throws an error.
\`\`\`javascript
function assert(condition, message) {

  "ehd-stack-overflow-error": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A "stack overflow" error occurs when there is a recursive function that never reaches its base case, causing it to call itself indefinitely. Each function call adds a new "frame" to the call stack. Because the call stack has a finite size, it eventually runs out of space, and the engine throws a \`RangeError\`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a different type of memory error. The **heap** is the region of memory where objects and other dynamic data are stored. A "heap out of memory" error occurs when an application tries to allocate more memory on the heap than is available, often due to a memory leak or trying to create an extremely large data structure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of code that would cause this error.
\`\`\`javascript
// This loop continuously allocates large arrays that cannot be garbage collected

  "ehd-uncaught-exception-node-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a Node.js-specific global error handler. The \`process\` object in Node.js is an event emitter. You can listen for the \`uncaughtException\` event, which is emitted when a synchronous error is thrown but not caught by any \`try...catch\` block.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual listener setup.
\`\`\`javascript
process.on('uncaughtException', (err, origin) => {
  console.error('There was an uncaught error:', err);
  // It is a best practice to exit the process after logging.
  process.exit(1);
});
\`\`\`
**Important**: The official Node.js documentation states that the correct use of this handler is for synchronous cleanup of allocated resources (e.g., file descriptors, handles) and then shutting down the process. It is **not** safe to resume normal operation because the application is in an unknown state.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a very advanced, low-level API in Node.js. The \`async_hooks\` module provides an API to track the lifecycle of asynchronous resources within a Node.js application.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
It's used to create "hooks" that are called at different stages of an async operation's life:
- \`init\`: When an async resource is created.
- \`before\`: Just before its callback is executed.
- \`after\`: Just after its callback has finished.
- \`destroy\`: When the resource is destroyed.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a best practice in application architecture. **Error normalization** is the process of catching various types of low-level errors (e.g., a database connection error, a third-party API timeout, a file system error) and wrapping them in a consistent set of application-specific custom errors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example.
\`\`\`javascript
class InternalServiceError extends Error { /* ... */ }
class UserInputError extends Error { /* ... */ }

  "ehd-idempotent-operations-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a key property of API requests related to error handling. An operation is **idempotent** if making the same request multiple times has the same effect as making it once.
- **Idempotent**: \`GET\`, \`PUT\`, \`DELETE\`.
- **Not Idempotent**: \`POST\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Consider a client trying to create a resource with \`POST /users\`. If the request is sent, but the client gets a network error, it doesn't know if the user was created or not. If the client simply retries the \`POST\` request, it might create two users. A \`DELETE /users/123\` request, however, is idempotent. If you retry it, the result is the same: user 123 is deleted.

This is important for error handling because it determines whether it is safe to automatically retry a failed request.

This is a conceptual problem about a crucial error handling mechanism in databases and other transactional systems. A **transaction** is a sequence of operations that must be executed as a single, atomic unit. Either all of the operations succeed, or none of them do.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of a bank transfer.
1. **Begin Transaction**: The process starts.
2. **Operation 1**: \`UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 'A';\`
3. **Operation 2**: \`UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 'B';\`
4. **Error Check**: If either operation fails, the system executes a **\`ROLLBACK\`**. This command undoes all the changes made since the transaction began.
5. **Commit**: If both operations succeed, the system executes a **\`COMMIT\`**, making the changes permanent.

This ensures that the database remains in a consistent state and money is never created or destroyed.

The debugging process involves:
1. **Gathering Data**: Collect all relevant data from the time of the incident:
   - Error logs (from a service like Sentry).
   - System metrics (CPU, memory, network traffic).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The classic "dining philosophers" example:
- **Process A**: Acquires Lock 1.
- **Process B**: Acquires Lock 2.
- **Process A**: Tries to acquire Lock 2, but it's held by B, so A waits.
- **Process B**: Tries to acquire Lock 1, but it's held by A, so B waits.
Both are now stuck waiting for each other.

**Prevention**: The primary way to prevent deadlocks is to ensure that all processes acquire locks in the same, consistent order.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Deadlock**: A common problem in multi-threaded or distributed systems.

  "ehd-flaky-test-debugging-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common issue in software testing. A **flaky test** is a test that passes sometimes and fails other times without any changes to the code. They are a major problem because they erode confidence in the test suite.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Common causes and debugging strategies:
- **Asynchronous Timing**: The most common cause. A test might not be properly \`await\`ing an asynchronous operation, creating a race condition between the operation and the test assertion. Debugging involves carefully reviewing all async code for missing \`await\`s.
- **Unmanaged State**: A previous test might have "leaked" some state (e.g., a modified global variable or a database entry) that affects a subsequent test. Ensure that tests have proper setup and teardown procedures to isolate them from each other.
- **External Dependencies**: The test might depend on an external service that is unreliable. Use mocks or stubs to isolate the test from external dependencies.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Test Isolation**: A fundamental principle of good testing practice.

  "ehd-chaos-engineering-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a modern discipline for testing the resilience of distributed systems. **Chaos Engineering** is the practice of proactively and deliberately injecting failures into a production system to see how it responds.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The process involves:
1.  **Hypothesize**: Form a hypothesis about how the system will behave in the face of a failure (e.g., "If one of our three API servers fails, traffic will be correctly rerouted to the other two with no impact on users.").
2.  **Experiment**: Deliberately cause that failure in a controlled production experiment (e.g., use a tool to shut down one of the servers).
3.  **Verify**: Measure the impact and see if the system behaved as expected.
4.  **Improve**: Use the results to improve the system's resilience.

This practice helps to uncover hidden weaknesses before they cause a real outage.

  "ehd-async-mutex-pattern": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A Mutex (Mutual Exclusion lock) is a mechanism to ensure that only one piece of code can access a "critical section" or resource at a time. This can be implemented for async operations using a promise chain to queue up tasks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual \`Mutex\` class.
\`\`\`javascript
class Mutex {
  constructor() {
    this.lock = Promise.resolve();
  }
  
  acquire(asyncFn) {
    this.lock = this.lock
      .then(() => asyncFn())
      .catch(() => {}); // Prevent unhandled rejections from breaking the lock
    return this.lock;
  }
}
// Usage:
// const mutex = new Mutex();
// mutex.acquire(() => criticalTask1());
// mutex.acquire(() => criticalTask2()); // This will wait for task1 to finish
\`\`\`
Each new task is chained onto the \`lock\` promise. The \`.then()\` ensures that the new task doesn't start until the previous one has finished.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Concurrency Control**: A pattern for managing access to a shared resource to prevent race conditions.

  "ehd-error-in-promise-constructor": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how the \`Promise\` constructor handles synchronous errors. If an error is thrown synchronously inside the executor function, the promise will be automatically rejected with that error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown inside the executor.
\`\`\`javascript
const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // This synchronous throw is caught by the promise constructor
  throw new Error("Sync error in executor");
});

p.catch(e => {
  console.log(e.message); // "Sync error in executor"
});

  "ehd-overriding-console-log-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a technique sometimes used in logging libraries or debugging tools. You can override the native \`console.log\` function (and other console methods) to intercept the messages being logged.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The pattern involves storing a reference to the original function and then replacing it with a new function.
\`\`\`javascript
// Store the original
const oldLog = console.log;

// Replace it with a new function
console.log = function(...args) {
  // 1. Perform custom action (e.g., send to a remote logging service)
  sendToRemoteService(args);
  
  // 2. Call the original function to maintain normal console behavior
  oldLog.apply(console, args);

This problem shows a practical use case for a \`Proxy\`: creating a wrapper around an object that logs all interactions. By implementing the \`get\` and \`set\` traps, we can intercept and log every property read and write, which is a powerful debugging tool.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy handler is created with logging \`get\` and \`set\` traps.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { val: 0 };
const handler = {
  get(obj, prop) {
    console.log(\`[LOG] Getting property: \${String(prop)}\`);

A nested function call is traced.
\`\`\`javascript
function a() {

  "ehd-debugging-binary-search": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about debugging a common algorithm. Binary search has several potential off-by-one errors.
- **Loop Condition**: Using \`left < right\` might cause the loop to terminate one iteration too early, missing the last element if it's the target. \`left <= right\` is generally safer.
- **Integer Overflow**: The standard way to calculate the middle index, \`mid = (left + right) / 2\`, can cause an integer overflow in languages with fixed-size integers if \`left\` and \`right\` are very large positive numbers. The safer way is \`mid = left + (right - left) / 2\`. While less of a concern with JavaScript's standard number type, it's a good habit to know.

  // problem explanation--> 101
  "ehd-debugging-incorrect-regex": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A regular expression (regex) is a powerful tool for pattern matching, but a common bug is to create a pattern that is "too permissive"‚Äîit matches strings it shouldn't. This often happens when the regex matches a *substring* instead of the *entire string*. The task is to understand how to make a regex stricter by anchoring it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solver provides a great example: a regex like \`/.com/\` intended to match a domain ending in ".com" will also incorrectly match 'test.com.net' because "com" is a substring. The fix is to use **anchors**.

- **\`^\`**: The caret anchor asserts the position at the start of the string.
- **\`$\`**: The dollar anchor asserts the position at the end of the string.

By changing the regex to \`/\.com$/\` (note the escaped dot \`\\.\` to match a literal period), we are now asserting that the string must *end* with ".com".

For a username validation, a permissive regex like \`/\\w+/\` might match "user@name". A stricter regex, \`/^\\w+$/\`, ensures that the entire string from start (\`^\`) to end (\`$\`) consists of one or more word characters, and nothing else.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**: A sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern.
- **Anchors (\`^\`, \`$\`)**: Metacharacters that match a position (start/end of string) rather than a character.
- **Substring vs. Full String Matching**: A crucial distinction in pattern matching. Anchors enforce a full string match.

  "ehd-console-dir": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
When debugging, we often need to inspect the properties of an object, especially complex ones like DOM elements. While \`console.log\` is the go-to, it can sometimes provide a simplified representation. \`console.dir\` is a specialized tool that always displays an interactive, expandable list of all the properties of a JavaScript object.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solver demonstrates this by logging the \`document.body\`.
- \`console.log(document.body)\`: In many browsers, this will show a clean, HTML-like representation of the \`<body>\` tag and its contents. This is useful for seeing the structure.
- \`console.dir(document.body)\`: This will show the \`HTMLBodyElement\` *object* itself. It displays a hierarchical list that you can expand to inspect all of its properties and methods, such as \`style\`, \`children\`, \`dataset\`, \`onclick\`, and many more inherited properties.

Use \`console.dir\` when you need to understand the underlying object model of an element, not just its visual representation.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`console.dir\`**: A console method for displaying an object's properties in a list.
- **DOM Object Model**: The tree of JavaScript objects that represents an HTML document.
- **Object Inspection**: The process of examining an object's properties and methods for debugging.

  "ehd-dom-breakpoint-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a powerful debugging technique for a common problem: you see a visual change on your webpage (an element appearing, disappearing, or changing style), but you don't know what JavaScript code caused it. A DOM change breakpoint tells the browser to pause JavaScript execution at the exact moment a specific DOM node is modified.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The steps are performed in the browser's developer tools:
1.  **Inspect the Element**: Right-click the element on the page that is being changed and choose \`Inspect\`. This opens the Elements panel with that node highlighted.
2.  **Set the Breakpoint**: Right-click on the highlighted HTML node in the Elements panel.
3.  **Choose "Break on..."**: In the context menu, you can choose:
    *   **Subtree modifications**: Pauses if a child element is added, removed, or changed. This is great for finding what code is adding a new item to a list.
    *   **Attribute modifications**: Pauses if an attribute (like \`class\`, \`style\`, or \`id\`) of the selected element changes. This is perfect for finding the code that adds a \`.active\` class.
    *   **Node removal**: Pauses only if the selected node itself is removed from the DOM.

When you trigger the action, the debugger will stop on the line of JavaScript that caused the modification.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Essential tools for front-end debugging.
- **DOM Breakpoints**: A type of breakpoint that is triggered by changes to the DOM instead of a line of code.

  "ehd-event-listener-breakpoint-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This technique is for debugging event-driven code. The problem is that you know an event (like a mouse click) is causing a bug, but in a large or unfamiliar codebase, it's hard to find where the \`addEventListener('click', ...)\` call is defined. An Event Listener Breakpoint tells the browser to pause on *any* code that runs in response to a specific type of event.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The steps are performed in browser dev tools:
1.  **Open Sources Panel**: Go to the "Sources" tab in your developer tools.
2.  **Find Event Listener Breakpoints Pane**: On the right-hand side panel, find and expand the "Event Listener Breakpoints" section.
3.  **Select Event Category**: You'll see a list of categories like \`Animation\`, \`Keyboard\`, \`Mouse\`, etc. Expand the relevant category (e.g., \`Mouse\`).
4.  **Check the Event**: Check the box for the specific event you want to debug (e.g., \`click\`).
5.  **Trigger the Event**: Go back to your web page and perform the action (e.g., click a button). The debugger will automatically pause inside the first line of the event listener callback function that handles that click, revealing exactly where it is in your code.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Event-Driven Programming**: The model where code execution is triggered by user actions or other events.
- **Debugger**: A powerful tool for pausing execution and tracing the flow of event-driven code.

  "ehd-xhr-breakpoint-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a debugging technique for network requests. The problem is that a network request is being sent unexpectedly, or with the wrong data, and you need to find the exact line of code that initiated it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual explanation of the steps in browser dev tools.
1.  **Open Sources Panel**: Go to the "Sources" tab in your developer tools.
2.  **Find XHR/fetch Breakpoints**: On the right-hand side panel, find the "XHR/fetch Breakpoints" section.
3.  **Set the Breakpoint**: You have two main options:
    *   Check "Any XHR or fetch": This will pause on *every* network request.
    *   Click the "+" button and add a URL filter: This is more useful. You can add a part of a URL (e.g., \`/api/users\`) and the debugger will only pause when a request is made to a URL containing that substring.
4.  **Trigger the Action**: Perform the action in your app that makes the network request. The debugger will pause on the line of code that calls \`fetch()\` or \`XMLHttpRequest.send()\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Network Debugging**: Essential for any application that communicates with a server.

When you are paused at a breakpoint, you often want to monitor the value of a variable or an expression as you step through the code. The "Watch" panel in developer tools is designed for this.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual explanation of the steps in browser dev tools.
1.  **Open Sources Panel**: Go to the "Sources" tab.
2.  **Set a Breakpoint**: Set a normal breakpoint in your code and run it until it pauses.
3.  **Find Watch Panel**: On the right-hand side panel, find and expand the "Watch" section.
4.  **Add Expression**: Click the "+" button to add a new expression. You can type any valid JavaScript expression, for example:

  "ehd-promise-that-never-settles": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A Promise represents an operation that will complete in the future. However, it's possible to create a Promise that *never* completes (neither resolves nor rejects). This can happen if the executor function doesn't call either of its arguments.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A Promise is created where the executor function is empty.
\`\`\`javascript
const p = new Promise(() => {
  // The 'resolve' and 'reject' functions are never called.
});

// An 'await' on this promise would pause execution forever.
// A .then() or .catch() attached to it would never run.
\`\`\`
This can be a source of subtle bugs where a part of your application seems to hang or never update, because it's waiting for a promise that will never settle.

  "ehd-error-in-promise-then": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how errors are handled within a Promise chain. If a synchronous error is thrown inside a \`.then()\` handler, it doesn't crash the program. Instead, the promise returned by that \`.then()\` is automatically rejected with the thrown error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown inside a \`.then()\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve()
  .then(() => {
    // This synchronous error will be caught by the promise machinery.
    throw new Error("Sync error in .then");
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // The rejection is caught here.
    return \`Caught rejected promise: \${error.message}\`;
  });
\`\`\`
This is a key feature that allows for unified error handling. Both asynchronous rejections and synchronous errors inside the chain are handled by the same \`.catch()\` block.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Error Propagation in Promises**: Promise chains automatically catch synchronous errors and convert them into rejections.

  // problem explanation--> 109
  "ehd-error-in-async-function": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the \`async/await\` equivalent of the previous problem. An \`async\` function always returns a promise. If a synchronous error is thrown inside an \`async\` function, the promise returned by that function is automatically rejected with the thrown error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown synchronously inside an async function.
\`\`\`javascript
async function test() {
  throw new Error("Sync error in async");
}

test().catch(error => {
  return \`Caught rejected promise: \${error.message}\`;

  "ehd-debugging-z-index": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a common CSS debugging problem. An element appears to be in the right place, but it's not clickable or interactive. The most common cause is that another element, which might be transparent, is positioned on top of it with a higher \`z-index\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual explanation of the debugging process in browser dev tools.
1.  **Inspect the Element**: Right-click the non-clickable element and choose "Inspect".
2.  **Check for Overlays**: Hover over the element's ancestors in the Elements panel. As you do, the browser will highlight the element's box on the page. Watch for another element being highlighted that covers your target element.
3.  **Check \`z-index\` and \`position\`**: In the "Styles" or "Computed" panel, look for the \`z-index\` and \`position\` properties. An element must have a \`position\` other than \`static\` (e.g., \`relative\`, \`absolute\`, \`fixed\`) for \`z-index\` to have an effect.
4.  **3D View**: Some browsers have a 3D or "Layers" view that can be very helpful for visualizing the stacking context of elements.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Stacking Context**: The set of rules in CSS that determines how elements are layered on top of each other.
- **\`z-index\`**: The CSS property that controls the stacking order of positioned elements.

  "ehd-debugging-cors-error": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a common network debugging problem. When your front-end code (e.g., from \`localhost:3000\`) tries to make a \`fetch\` request to a different domain (e.g., \`api.example.com\`), the browser enforces the **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)** security policy. If the server doesn't explicitly allow your origin, the browser will block the request and show a CORS error in the console.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a conceptual explanation of the debugging process.
1.  **Check the Console**: The error message will usually say something like "Access to fetch... has been blocked by CORS policy".
2.  **Open the Network Panel**: Go to the Network tab in dev tools and find the failed request (it will likely be red).
3.  **Examine Headers**: Click on the request and look at the "Headers" tab.
    *   In the "Request Headers", you will see an \`Origin\` header (e.g., \`localhost:3000\`).
    *   In the "Response Headers", you need to look for the \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin\` header.
4.  **The Fix**: The server at \`api.example.com\` must be configured to send back a response header of \`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: localhost:3000\` (or \`*\` for public APIs). This is a server-side fix.

  "ehd-debugging-type-coercion": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem highlights a classic JavaScript bug caused by implicit type coercion. The \`+\` operator can mean either addition or string concatenation. If one of the operands is a string, it will perform concatenation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The buggy code adds a string and a number.
\`\`\`javascript
const val1 = "5"; // A string
const val2 = 3;   // A number
const buggyResult = val1 + val2; // "53" (concatenation)
\`\`\`
The fix is to **explicitly** convert the string to a number before performing the addition.
\`\`\`javascript
const fixedResult = Number(val1) + val2; // 8 (addition)
\`\`\`
Relying on implicit coercion can lead to unexpected results. Explicit conversion makes your code's intent clear and prevents these kinds of bugs.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Type Coercion**: The automatic conversion of a value from one data type to another. It's a powerful but sometimes confusing feature.
- **Explicit Conversion**: Manually converting a value's type (e.g., with \`Number()\`, \`String()\`), which is safer and clearer.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a developer tools feature. When debugging, you often step through code line by line. However, you usually don't care about stepping into the internal code of third-party libraries (like React or jQuery). "Blackboxing" (or "ignoring") a script tells the debugger to treat that script as a black box: it will never pause inside it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The steps in browser dev tools:
1. Open the "Sources" panel.
2. Find the library file you want to ignore in the file navigator.
3. Right-click on the file and select "Add script to ignore list" (or a similar option).
Now, when you are stepping through your own code and you step on a line that calls a function from that library, the debugger will execute the library code but will not pause until execution returns to your own code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Modern JavaScript bundlers like Webpack or Rollup perform an optimization called **tree shaking**.
1.  **Static Analysis**: The bundler statically analyzes the \`import\` and \`export\` statements in your code. It builds a dependency graph of which functions and variables are actually used.
2.  **Elimination**: During the final bundling process, any exported code that was not found to be used by any part of the application is simply excluded from the final output file.
This process significantly reduces the size of your production JavaScript bundles, which improves application load times.

  "ehd-try-catch-performance-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about the performance of \`try...catch\` blocks. In the early days of JavaScript, the presence of a \`try...catch\` block would prevent the JavaScript engine from applying many of its powerful JIT (Just-In-Time) compiler optimizations to that function, making it run significantly slower.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Modern JavaScript engines like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js) are now extremely good at optimizing functions that contain \`try...catch\` blocks.
- **The \`try\` block itself has negligible performance cost.** The engine can optimize the code inside it just fine.
- **The \`catch\` block has a cost *only when an error is actually thrown*.** When an exception occurs, the engine has to de-optimize, unwind the stack, and find the handler, which is an expensive process.

**Best Practice**: Do not be afraid to use \`try...catch\` for its intended purpose of handling exceptional situations. However, do not use it for normal control flow (e.g., throwing an error to exit a loop), as this will be slow.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**: The process modern engines use to compile JavaScript to native machine code at runtime for high performance.

  "ehd-error-in-generator-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about error handling in generator functions. Generators have a special method on their iterator object called \`.throw()\`. This method allows you to "inject" an error from the outside into the generator. The error will appear as if it were thrown at the point where the generator is currently paused (at a \`yield\` statement).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The generator can catch the injected error with a \`try...catch\` block.
\`\`\`javascript
function* gen() {
  try {
    yield 1;
  } catch (e) {
    console.log("Generator caught error:", e.message);
  }
}
const g = gen();
g.next(); // Starts the generator, pauses at 'yield 1'

g.throw(new Error("Injected!")); // Injects an error
\`\`\`
This two-way error handling makes generators a powerful tool for managing complex control flows.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Generator \`.throw()\` method**: A way for external code to send an error into a paused generator.

  "ehd-debugging-event-propagation": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about debugging the flow of DOM events. When an event (like a click) happens on an element, it goes through two phases:
1.  **Capturing Phase**: The event travels from the \`window\` down to the target element.
2.  **Bubbling Phase**: The event travels from the target element back up to the \`window\`.

A common bug is that an event handler on a parent element is unexpectedly triggered by a click on a child element (due to bubbling).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Browser dev tools are used to debug this.
1.  **Inspect Element**: Inspect the element where the event is occurring.
2.  **Event Listeners Tab**: In the Elements panel, find the "Event Listeners" tab.
3.  **Trace Propagation**: This tab shows you all the event listeners for the selected event type (e.g., \`click\`) attached to the element itself and all of its ancestors. You can see the entire propagation path.
4.  **\`event.stopPropagation()\`**: To fix the bug, you might add \`event.stopPropagation()\` in the child element's event handler to prevent the event from bubbling up to its parents.

The \`console.dirxml()\` method is a specialized console method that is useful for displaying an interactive XML or HTML tree representation of a DOM element.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The method is called with a DOM element as its argument.
\`\`\`javascript
// In a browser console
console.dirxml(document.body);

  "ehd-sentinel-value-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a programming pattern. A **sentinel value** is a special, out-of-band value that is used to indicate a specific condition, often the termination of a process or the absence of a result.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A classic example in JavaScript is the \`.indexOf()\` method.
\`\`\`javascript
const arr = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
arr.indexOf('b'); // 1
arr.indexOf('d'); // -1
\`\`\`
Here, **-1** is the sentinel value. Since -1 cannot be a valid array index, it's a safe and unambiguous way to signal that the element was not found. Other examples include a pointer being \`null\` to indicate the end of a linked list.

  "ehd-async-queue-with-error-handling": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to implement a queue that processes async tasks sequentially, but with robust error handling. If one task in the queue fails, the entire queue should stop processing, and the error should be reported.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This can be implemented using an \`async\` function and a \`for...of\` loop, which handles promises correctly.
\`\`\`javascript
async function processQueue(tasks) {
  for (const task of tasks) {
    // The try...catch is inside the loop to report which task failed,
    // but the re-throw stops the entire process.

      console.error('A task failed, stopping queue.', error);
      throw error; // Rethrow to stop further processing
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Asynchronous Control Flow**: Managing the execution order of async tasks.
- **Error Propagation**: Rethrowing a caught error allows it to be handled by a higher-level handler and stops the current execution flow.

This is a conceptual problem about a powerful debugging technique. "Rubber duck debugging" is the process of solving a problem by explaining it, line by line, to an inanimate object (like a rubber duck).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The act of articulating the problem and the code's intended behavior forces you to slow down and view it from a different perspective. This often leads to spotting the logical flaw or typo that was previously overlooked.
1.  Get an inanimate object.
2.  Explain to the object what your code is *supposed* to do.
3.  Explain, line by line, what your code *actually* does.
4.  The discrepancy between what it's supposed to do and what it's doing often becomes obvious during this process.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a systematic debugging strategy. The bisection method is a way to quickly narrow down the location of a bug in a large block of code. It's essentially a manual binary search for the line causing the error.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Identify a block of code** where you know a bug is occurring.
2.  **Comment out half the code**: Temporarily comment out the second half of the block.
3.  **Run and check**:
    *   If the bug still occurs, you know it's in the first half of the code.
    *   If the bug disappears, you know it's in the half you commented out.
4.  **Repeat**: Take the new, smaller block of code where the bug resides and repeat the process, commenting out half of it again. Continue this process until you have narrowed the bug down to just a few lines.

  "ehd-error-in-web-worker-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. A Web Worker runs in a separate thread. If an unhandled error occurs inside the worker's script, it does not crash the main page. Instead, it terminates the worker and fires an \`error\` event on the worker object in the main thread.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
You handle worker errors by attaching an \`onerror\` event handler.
\`\`\`javascript
// --- main.js ---
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');
myWorker.onerror = (event) => {
  // The event object contains details about the error

  "ehd-debugging-css-cascade": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common CSS debugging task. The "cascade" in CSS is the set of rules that determines which styles are applied to an element when multiple rules could apply. A common bug is that a style you've written is being overridden by another rule.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Browser dev tools are essential for this.
1.  **Inspect Element**: Right-click the element and choose "Inspect".
2.  **Styles Panel**: In the "Styles" panel, you will see a list of all CSS rules that apply to the element, from highest specificity to lowest.
3.  **Overridden Styles**: Any style that has been overridden will be shown with a strikethrough line.
4.  **Computed Panel**: The "Computed" tab is even more powerful. It shows the final, calculated value for every single CSS property on the element, and you can expand each property to see the cascade (the list of all rules that tried to set that property, and which one "won").

  "ehd-silent-errors-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a dangerous class of programming errors. "Silent errors" are pieces of code that fail to produce the correct result but do not throw an error or warning, making them very hard to debug.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Examples include:
- **Empty \`catch\` block**: \`try { ... } catch (e) { /* Fails silently */ }\`. The error is swallowed, and the program continues in a potentially broken state.
- **Failed Assignment in Non-Strict Mode**: Assigning to a non-writable property in non-strict mode fails silently.
- **Incorrect Logic**: A logical error in an algorithm (e.g., an off-by-one error) that produces a wrong but plausible result.

The best defense is to use **strict mode** (which turns some silent errors into thrown errors) and to be very careful with empty \`catch\` blocks.

  "ehd-promise-race-and-memory-leaks-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a subtle memory leak that can occur when using \`Promise.race()\`. \`Promise.race\` settles as soon as the first promise settles. However, it does **not** cancel the other promises. If these "losing" promises are holding onto resources (like a network connection, a large object in a closure, or an event listener), those resources will not be released.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example.
\`\`\`javascript
const slowPromise = new Promise(resolve => {
  const largeObject = new Array(1000000); // 1. Resource is allocated
  setTimeout(() => resolve(largeObject), 5000);
});
const fastPromise = Promise.resolve("fast");

Promise.race([slowPromise, fastPromise]);
// The race finishes quickly, but the 'largeObject' inside 'slowPromise'
// will still be held in memory for the full 5 seconds until its timer fires.
\`\`\`
The solution is to use an \`AbortController\` to explicitly cancel the losing promises.

  "ehd-debugging-timing-issues": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem describes a classic timing issue in front-end development. A script tries to manipulate a DOM element, but it fails because the script runs *before* the browser has parsed the HTML and created that element in the DOM.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is to ensure the script runs only after the DOM is ready.
1. **The Problem**:
   \`\`\`html
   <script>
     // This runs immediately, but the #my-element doesn't exist yet
     document.getElementById('my-element').textContent = 'Hello'; // Throws TypeError
   </script>
   <div id="my-element"></div>
   \`\`\`
2. **The Fix**: Wrap the code in a \`DOMContentLoaded\` event listener. This event fires once the initial HTML document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets and images.
   \`\`\`javascript
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
     // This code is guaranteed to run after the DOM is ready
     document.getElementById('my-element').textContent = 'Hello';
   });
   \`\`\`
Another common solution is to place the \`<script>\` tag at the end of the \`<body>\`.

  "ehd-error-in-json-replacer": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a tricky error handling scenario. The \`JSON.stringify\` method can take a "replacer" function to customize serialization. If an error is thrown from *within* this replacer function, it may not be catchable by a surrounding \`try...catch\` block.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
\`JSON.stringify\` throws a \`TypeError\` when it encounters a \`BigInt\`, as they cannot be serialized by default. This error originates from the internal serialization logic.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  // This will throw a TypeError: Do not know how to serialize a BigInt
  JSON.stringify({ a: 1n });

This is a conceptual problem about a particularly difficult type of bug. A "Heisenbug" (named after the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) is a bug that seems to alter its behavior or disappear when you try to debug it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The cause is usually that the act of observing the system changes its behavior. Common causes include:
- **Race Conditions**: Adding a \`console.log\` or pausing in a debugger can change the timing of asynchronous operations, making the race condition not manifest.
- **Uninitialized Memory**: A variable might have a "garbage" value that just happens to work, but when you inspect it in the debugger, its value is shown as \`undefined\` or zero, changing the outcome.
- **Compiler Optimizations**: The debugger might run un-optimized code, while the bug only appears in the optimized version.

Debugging Heisenbugs requires careful logging, code reviews, and reasoning about the system's logic rather than just direct observation.

  "ehd-idempotency-and-retries": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a crucial principle in distributed systems and API design. An operation is "idempotent" if performing it multiple times has the same effect as performing it once.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
When handling errors, especially network errors, you might want to retry a request.
- If the operation is idempotent, it's always safe to retry.
- If it's not idempotent, retrying could cause duplicate data or incorrect state. In this case, the client and server need a mechanism (like a unique request ID) to recognize and handle the retry safely.

  "ehd-debugging-css-specificity": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about CSS debugging. "Specificity" is the algorithm browsers use to determine which CSS property value is the most relevant to an element, thereby determining the property value to be applied. A common bug is that a CSS rule you write isn't applied because another, more specific rule, is overriding it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The "Styles" panel in browser dev tools is the key.
1. Inspect the element.
2. The Styles panel will show all rules that match the element.
3. Rules are listed in order of specificity (highest first). Any property that is overridden by a more specific rule will be shown with a strikethrough.
4. This allows you to see exactly which selector "won" the specificity battle. For example, an ID selector (\`#my-id\`) is more specific than a class selector (\`.my-class\`), which is more specific than a tag selector (\`div\`).

### üìö Key Concepts

  "ehd-dom-exception-names-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a specific type of error. A \`DOMException\` is an error object that represents an error related to a Web API. They have a \`name\` property that gives a more specific error code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Common \`DOMException\` names include:
- **\`NotFoundError\`**: Thrown by APIs like \`navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia\` if no camera or microphone can be found.
- **\`NotAllowedError\`**: Thrown if the user denies a permission request (e.g., for notifications or camera access).
- **\`AbortError\`**: The error that a \`fetch\` promise rejects with when it is cancelled by an \`AbortController\`.
- **\`InvalidStateError\`**: Thrown when an operation is performed on an object that is in an inappropriate state.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Web APIs**: Browser-provided APIs for interacting with the user and system resources.
- **Error Codes**: Using the \`.name\` property helps you handle different API failures in different ways.

  "ehd-promise-chain-no-return": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This highlights a common pitfall in promise chains. If you forget to \`return\` a value (or another promise) from a \`.then()\` handler, the next \`.then()\` in the chain will receive \`undefined\` as its argument.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A missing \`return\` breaks the flow of data.
\`\`\`javascript
Promise.resolve(10)
  .then(val => {
    val + 1; // The result is calculated but not returned
  })
  .then(val => {
    // 'val' here is undefined
    console.log('Next value:', val);
  });
\`\`\`
**The Fix**: Always ensure you \`return\` the value you want to pass to the next step: \`return val + 1;\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Promise Chaining**: The return value of a \`.then()\` handler determines the resolved value for the next step.

  "ehd-debugging-api-rate-limits": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common production issue. If your application makes too many requests to an API in a short period, the server may "rate limit" you, responding with an **HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests"** status code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The debugging and handling process:
1.  **Identify**: Use the Network panel in dev tools to find the requests that are failing with a 429 status.
2.  **Inspect Response**: Look at the response headers. The server often includes a \`Retry-After\` header, which tells you how many seconds to wait before making another request.
3.  **The Fix (Client-side)**:
    - Implement client-side rate limiting (e.g., don't allow a button to be clicked more than once per second).
    - Implement an **exponential backoff** strategy for retries. If a request fails with a 429, wait for a short period (e.g., 1 second) and retry. If it fails again, wait for a longer period (e.g., 2 seconds), then 4, and so on.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **API Rate Limiting**: A server-side mechanism to prevent abuse and ensure service stability.
- **Exponential Backoff**: A standard client-side strategy for handling rate limits gracefully.

  "ehd-finalization-registry-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is an advanced conceptual problem. A \`FinalizationRegistry\` (ES2021) provides a way to request a callback to be run after an object has been garbage collected. This is used for cleanup of resources that are not managed by JavaScript's memory manager (e.g., a file handle or a connection to a WebAssembly module).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of its usage.
\`\`\`javascript
// Create a registry with a cleanup callback
const registry = new FinalizationRegistry(heldValue => {
  console.log(\`An object was garbage collected, cleaning up: \${heldValue}\`);
});

(function() {
  const obj = {};
  // Register 'obj'. When 'obj' is garbage collected,
  // the callback will be called with "SomeResourceID".
  registry.register(obj, "SomeResourceID");
})();
// Sometime after this IIFE finishes, the message will be logged.
\`\`\`
**Important**: The callback is not guaranteed to run, and if it does, its timing is unpredictable. It should only be used for cleanup, not for any critical application logic.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Garbage Collection**: The process that triggers the registry's callback.
- **Resource Management**: The primary use case for this advanced API.

  "ehd-weakmap-for-private-data": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates a classic pattern for creating private data associated with an object, used before the \`#\` private fields syntax was introduced. A \`WeakMap\` is used, where the object instances are the keys and an object of private data is the value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`WeakMap\` is used to store private data for a class.
\`\`\`javascript
const privateData = new WeakMap();

class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    // 'this' (the instance) is the key.
    privateData.set(this, { name: name });
  }
  getName() {
    return privateData.get(this).name;
  }
}
const p = new Person("Victor");
p.getName(); // "Victor"
\`\`\`
Because it's a \`WeakMap\`, if the \`p\` instance is garbage collected, its entry in the \`WeakMap\` will also be removed, preventing memory leaks.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **\`WeakMap\`**: A map that holds weak references to its keys, allowing them to be garbage collected.
- **Closures**: The \`privateData\` map is kept in a closure, making it inaccessible from outside the module.

  "ehd-weakset-for-object-tracking": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A \`WeakSet\` is a special collection object that only stores objects and holds them "weakly." This means that if an object in the \`WeakSet\` has no other references to it in the program, it can be garbage collected. This makes \`WeakSet\` ideal for tracking a group of objects without causing memory leaks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An object is added to a \`WeakSet\`. When the only reference to that object is removed, it becomes eligible for garbage collection, and will eventually be removed from the \`WeakSet\`.
\`\`\`javascript
const ws = new WeakSet();
let obj1 = { id: 1 };
let obj2 = { id: 2 };

ws.add(obj1);
ws.add(obj2);

ws.has(obj1); // true

// Remove the only strong reference to obj1
obj1 = null; 

// After garbage collection (which is non-deterministic), 
// ws.has(obj1) would become false.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Weak References**: A reference that does not prevent an object from being garbage collected.
- **Memory Management**: \`WeakSet\` is a tool for managing memory by avoiding unintentional memory leaks.

  "ehd-prototype-pollution-conceptual": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a type of security vulnerability. Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker finds a way to modify the properties of \`Object.prototype\`. Since most objects in JavaScript inherit from \`Object.prototype\`, this modification can affect almost every object in an application, potentially leading to denial-of-service or remote code execution. This often happens through unsafe merging of objects with user-supplied data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A conceptual example of an unsafe merge.
\`\`\`javascript
// Attacker sends a malicious JSON payload like:
// {"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}

// An unsafe recursive merge function might do this:
// merge(target, source) -> target["__proto__"]["isAdmin"] = true
// This modifies Object.prototype itself!

// Now, any new object will have this property:
const user = {};
// user.isAdmin is now true!
\`\`\`
### üìö Key Concepts
- **Prototype Pollution**: A security vulnerability.
- **Defensive Programming**: Libraries should have checks to prevent modification of keys like \`__proto__\`, \`constructor\`, and \`prototype\`.

  "ehd-revocable-proxy": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
\`Proxy.revocable()\` is a factory method that creates a proxy that can be "turned off." It returns an object with two properties: \`proxy\` and \`revoke\`. Calling the \`revoke()\` function disables the proxy, and any further operations on it will throw a \`TypeError\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A proxy is created and then revoked.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = { a: 1 };
const { proxy, revoke } = Proxy.revocable(target, {});

console.log(proxy.a); // 1

revoke(); // Turn off the proxy

// console.log(proxy.a); // Throws TypeError
\`\`\`
This is useful for managing access to an object and being able to completely cut off that access when it's no longer needed.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Revocable Proxy**: A proxy that can be disabled.
- **Resource Management**: A pattern for controlling access to an object.

  "ehd-error-in-destructuring-assignment": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a common error that occurs when trying to destructure a value that is \`null\` or \`undefined\`. Destructuring is a property access operation. Since \`null\` and \`undefined\` have no properties, attempting to "get" a property from them throws a \`TypeError\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The code attempts to destructure from a \`null\` or \`undefined\` value.
\`\`\`javascript
const source = null;
// const { a } = source; // Throws TypeError
\`\`\`
To prevent this error defensively, you can provide a default object if the source might be nullish:
\`\`\`javascript
// Using the nullish coalescing operator '??'
const { a = 'default' } = source ?? {}; 
// 'a' will be 'default', no error is thrown.

This problem demonstrates a powerful feature of generators: the ability to inject an error into them from the outside. The \`.throw()\` method on a generator's iterator resumes the generator's execution as if a \`throw\` statement occurred at the point of the last \`yield\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown into a running generator, where it is caught by an internal \`try...catch\` block.
\`\`\`javascript

  "ehd-error-in-async-generator": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about handling errors in an \`async function*\`. Errors can be handled both inside the generator and by the consumer.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Errors can be managed in two main ways:
1.  **Internal \`try...catch\`**: The generator itself can wrap \`yield\` statements in a \`try...catch\` to handle errors without terminating.
2.  **External \`try...catch\`**: The consumer of the async generator can wrap the \`for-await-of\` loop in a \`try...catch\` block. If an unhandled error is thrown from inside the generator, it will reject the promise returned by the iterator's \`.next()\` method, which will be caught by the external block.
\`\`\`javascript
// Conceptual
async function* myAsyncGen() {
  yield 1;
  throw new Error('Generator failed!');

  "ehd-debugging-event-listener-options": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a useful browser console utility. In many modern browsers (like Chrome and Firefox), you can use the \`getEventListeners(element)\` function directly in the console to inspect all event listeners that are currently attached to a specific DOM element.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  Open your browser's developer tools.
2.  Go to the "Elements" panel and select a DOM node. The selected node is now available in the console as the variable \`$0\`.
3.  Go to the "Console" panel and type: \`getEventListeners($0)\`
4.  The console will return an object where the keys are the event types (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover') and the values are arrays of listener objects attached to that element.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about debugging styles generated by CSS-in-JS libraries (like Styled Components or Emotion). The main challenge is that the class names are dynamically generated and often look like gibberish (e.g., \`css-1q2w3e4\`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Strategies for debugging:
1.  **Browser Dev Tools**: The primary tool. You can inspect the element to see the generated class name and the corresponding CSS rules in the "Styles" panel.
2.  **Source Maps**: Good CSS-in-JS libraries generate source maps. This allows the browser to show you the original component and line of code that generated the style, even though the class name is cryptic.

  "ehd-debugging-event-listeners-leaks": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a common source of memory leaks in front-end applications. A memory leak occurs if you add an event listener to an element but never remove it when the element is no longer needed. The listener can hold a reference to the element and other objects in its closure, preventing them from being garbage collected.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
- **The Problem**: A component is created, adds an event listener to \`window\`, and is then destroyed without removing the listener.
- **The Fix**: The component must have a cleanup function (e.g., in React, the return function from \`useEffect\`) that calls \`window.removeEventListener\`.
- **Debugging**:
  1. Use the Memory tab in dev tools to take heap snapshots. If you create and destroy the component multiple times, you will see the number of listeners and related objects grow with each snapshot.
  2. Use \`getEventListeners(window)\` in the console to see the list of attached listeners.

  "ehd-debugging-content-security-policy": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a web security feature. A Content Security Policy (CSP) is an HTTP header that tells the browser which resources (scripts, styles, images) are allowed to be loaded and from which origins. It's a defense against Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
- **The Error**: When a page tries to load a resource that violates the CSP, the browser blocks the resource and reports a detailed error message in the developer console. The message typically looks like: \`Refused to load the script '...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "..."\`.
- **Debugging**: The console error tells you exactly which directive was violated (e.g., \`script-src\`) and what resource was blocked. The fix involves modifying the CSP header on the server to either allow the new origin or, if it's an unexpected resource, investigating how it's being injected into your page.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about debugging low-level data. When working with binary protocols (e.g., WebSockets, files, WebAssembly), you often deal with data as a sequence of bytes in an \`ArrayBuffer\`. Debugging this requires tools to interpret those bytes.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **\`DataView\`**: This is a key JavaScript object. It provides a low-level interface for reading and writing data in an \`ArrayBuffer\` with control over byte order (endianness). You can use methods like \`.getUint8()\`, \`.getInt32()\`, etc., to read specific data types from specific byte offsets.
2.  **Hexadecimal Logging**: It's often helpful to log numeric values in hexadecimal (\`num.toString(16)\`) as this format is more compact and aligns well with byte boundaries. You can then compare your logged hex values against the protocol's specification.
3.  **Debugger**: The browser debugger allows you to inspect \`ArrayBuffer\`s and will often provide a view of the underlying bytes.

  "ehd-debugging-strict-mode-errors": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates how "strict mode" helps in debugging by turning silent errors into thrown errors.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Assigning to a non-writable property is a good example.
\`\`\`javascript
// Non-strict mode
const obj = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj, 'a', { value: 1, writable: false });
obj.a = 2; // Fails silently, obj.a is still 1

// Strict mode
'use strict';
const obj2 = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj2, 'a', { value: 1, writable: false });
// obj2.a = 2; // Throws a TypeError
\`\`\`
Strict mode makes the code more robust by making these kinds of failed operations immediately visible as thrown errors.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Strict Mode**: A more restrictive variant of JavaScript that prevents silent errors.

  "ehd-error-in-proxy-trap": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows how errors are handled when they originate from within a \`Proxy\` trap. If a trap function (like \`get\` or \`set\`) throws an error, that error propagates out and can be caught by a standard \`try...catch\` block in the code that performed the operation on the proxy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An error is thrown from a \`get\` trap.
\`\`\`javascript
const target = {};
const handler = {
  get() {
    throw new Error("Intercepted!");
  }
};
const proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);

try {
  proxy.a; // This operation triggers the trap, which throws an error.
} catch (e) {
  // The error is caught here.
}

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Proxy Traps**: The handler functions that intercept operations.
- **Error Propagation**: Errors thrown within traps propagate to the calling code.

  "ehd-suppressed-error-example": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem demonstrates the structure of a \`SuppressedError\` (ES2023). This special error type is designed to hold two errors: a main error that takes precedence, and a "suppressed" error that occurred during a cleanup phase.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A \`SuppressedError\` is manually created and thrown.
\`\`\`javascript
try {
  const suppressed = new Error("Suppressed cleanup error");
  const main = new Error("Main operation error");
  // The constructor takes the main error, the suppressed error, and a message.
  throw new SuppressedError(main, suppressed, "An error was suppressed during cleanup");

  "ehd-debugging-with-object-freeze": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem shows a powerful debugging technique. If you suspect that an object is being mutated somewhere in your codebase unintentionally, you can use \`Object.freeze()\` on it. If any part of the code later tries to change a property of the frozen object, it will throw a \`TypeError\` in strict mode.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Freezing an object helps pinpoint a mutation.
\`\`\`javascript
'use strict';
function someThirdPartyFunc(config) {
  // This function has a bug and mutates the config
  config.setting = 'changed'; 
}

const myConfig = { setting: 'original' };
Object.freeze(myConfig);

// When this function is called, it will now throw a TypeError,
// immediately showing you where the unintended mutation is happening.
// someThirdPartyFunc(myConfig);

  "ehd-error-in-destructuring-assignment-with-defaults": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem clarifies that providing a default value for a *property* during destructuring does not prevent a \`TypeError\` if the *source object itself* is \`null\` or \`undefined\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The destructuring fails before the default value can be applied.
\`\`\`javascript
const source = null;
// The engine first tries to access properties on 'source'.
// Since 'source' is null, this throws a TypeError.
// The default value 'a = 1' is never reached.
// const { a = 1 } = source; // Throws TypeError
\`\`\`
The fix is to provide a default for the source object: \`const { a = 1 } = source || {};\`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Order of Operations**: The property access happens before the default value is considered.

  "ehd-error-event-on-window": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about creating a global "catch-all" error handler in the browser. You can do this by adding an event listener for the \`error\` event on the \`window\` object. This will catch any unhandled synchronous errors that occur in your scripts.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A listener is attached to the window.
\`\`\`javascript
window.addEventListener('error', (event) => {
  // event is an ErrorEvent object
  console.log('Caught a global error!');
  console.log('Message:', event.message);

  "ehd-debugging-unicode-issues": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem deals with how JavaScript handles complex Unicode characters, like modern emoji that are composed of multiple code points (surrogate pairs). The \`.length\` property of a string counts UTF-16 code units, not the number of visible characters.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The length of a complex emoji is analyzed.
\`\`\`javascript
const emoji = 'üë©‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶';
emoji.length; // 11! The visible character is composed of 11 code units.

// The correct way to count characters is to convert the string to an array.
Array.from(emoji).length; // 1
\`\`\`
When iterating or processing strings with complex Unicode, always use methods that are aware of code points (like \`for...of\` or \`Array.from\`) instead of \`.length\` and bracket notation, which can split a character in half.

### üìö Key Concepts

  "ehd-safe-integer-check": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
JavaScript's standard \`Number\` type uses 64-bit floating-point representation. This means it can only safely represent integers up to \`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER\`. Beyond this point, precision can be lost. The \`Number.isSafeInteger()\` method is used to check if a number is within this safe range.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A safe and an unsafe integer are checked.
\`\`\`javascript
Number.isSafeInteger(9007199254740991); // true
Number.isSafeInteger(9007199254740992); // false

9007199254740992 === 9007199254740993; // true! Precision is lost.

  "ehd-error-in-web-worker-from-main": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem. A Web Worker runs in a separate thread. If an unhandled error occurs inside the worker's script, it does not crash the main page. Instead, it terminates the worker and fires an \`error\` event on the worker object in the main thread.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
You handle worker errors by attaching an \`onerror\` event handler.
\`\`\`javascript
// --- main.js ---
const myWorker = new Worker('worker.js');
myWorker.onerror = (event) => {
  // The event object contains details about the error
  console.error(\`Error in worker: \${event.message} at \${event.filename}:\${event.lineno}\`);

  "ehd-debugging-with-geteventlisteners": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a useful browser console utility. In many modern browsers (like Chrome and Firefox), you can use the \`getEventListeners(element)\` function directly in the console to inspect all event listeners that are currently attached to a specific DOM element.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  Open your browser's developer tools.
2.  Go to the "Elements" panel and select a DOM node. The selected node is now available in the console as the variable \`$0\`.
3.  Go to the "Console" panel and type: \`getEventListeners($0)\`
4.  The console will return an object where the keys are the event types (e.g., 'click', 'mouseover') and the values are arrays of listener objects attached to that element.

This is extremely helpful for debugging issues like duplicate event listeners or finding what code is responsible for a particular event.

  "ehd-debugging-with-sourcemaps": `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a conceptual problem about a critical tool in modern web development. When you deploy a web application, you usually minify your JavaScript code to make the files smaller. This process renames variables and removes whitespace, making the code unreadable. A **source map** is a special file that creates a mapping between the minified code and your original source code.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The debugging process is enabled by this mapping.
1.  **Build Process**: Your build tool (like Webpack or Vite) generates both the minified \`.js\` file and a corresponding \`.js.map\` file.
2.  **Browser Dev Tools**: When you open the developer tools on your production site, the browser sees a special comment in the minified file that points to the source map.
3.  **Mapping**: The browser downloads the source map and uses it to display your original, readable code in the "Sources" panel.
4.  **Benefits**:
    *   **Breakpoints**: You can set breakpoints in your original code.
    *   **Stack Traces**: Error stack traces show the original file names and line numbers, making it possible to debug production errors.
