  'as-reverse-string': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to take a string of text and reverse the order of its characters. For example, "hello" should become "olleh". This is a classic string manipulation problem that introduces you to working with strings as if they were arrays.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution uses a chain of three common string and array methods.
\`\`\`javascript
function reverseString(str) {
  return str.split('').reverse().join('');
}
\`\`\`
1.  **\`str.split('')\`**: The \`.split('')\` method, with an empty string as an argument, splits the string into an array of its individual characters.
    -   \`"hello"\` becomes \`['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']\`
2.  **\`.reverse()\`**: This array method reverses the order of the elements in the array in-place.
    -   The array becomes \`['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']\`
3.  **\`.join('')\`**: This array method joins all the elements back into a single string. The empty string argument means no separator is placed between them.
    -   The final result is \`"olleh"\`

### üìö Key Concepts
- **String Manipulation**: The process of changing, editing, or analyzing strings.
- **Method Chaining**: Calling one method after another on the result of the previous one in a single statement.

  'as-is-palindrome': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. The task is to write a function that can verify if a given string is a palindrome. For this problem, we need to consider only alphanumeric characters and ignore case.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A robust solution involves cleaning the string first, and then using a two-pointer technique to check for symmetry.
\`\`\`javascript
function isPalindrome(str) {
    const cleaned = str.toLowerCase().replace(/[\W_]/g, "");
    let left = 0;
    let right = cleaned.length - 1;
    while(left < right) {
        if(cleaned[left] !== cleaned[right]) {
            return false;
        }
        left++;
        right--;
    }
    return true;
}
\`\`\`
1.  **Cleaning**: \`.toLowerCase()\` converts the string to lowercase. \`.replace(/[\W_]/g, "")\` uses a regular expression to remove all non-alphanumeric characters.
2.  **Two Pointers**: We set a \`left\` pointer at the start and a \`right\` pointer at the end.
3.  **Comparison**: We loop while \`left\` is less than \`right\`. If the characters at the two pointers ever don't match, we know it's not a palindrome and can return \`false\` immediately. Otherwise, we move the pointers closer to the center.
4.  **Result**: If the loop finishes without finding a mismatch, the string is a palindrome.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **String Normalization**: Cleaning the string into a standard format is a crucial first step for many string problems.
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: An efficient pattern for checking symmetry or searching from both ends of a sequence.

  'as-anagram-check': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another. The task is to check if two strings are anagrams. If they are, they must contain the exact same characters with the exact same frequencies.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The simplest approach is to create a "canonical" (standard) representation for both strings and compare them. Sorting the characters of the strings is a great way to do this.
\`\`\`javascript
function isAnagram(str1, str2) {
  const clean = s => s.toLowerCase().replace(/[\W_]/g, '').split('').sort().join('');
  return clean(str1) === clean(str2);
}

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to modify an array in-place by moving all the zero elements to the end, while preserving the relative order of the non-zero elements.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient solution uses a single loop and a "write pointer" to place non-zero elements.
1.  Initialize a \`writeIndex = 0\`. This pointer keeps track of the position where the next non-zero element should be placed.
2.  Iterate through the array with a `readIndex`.
3.  If the element at `readIndex` is **not** zero:
    - Swap the elements at `writeIndex` and `readIndex`.
    - Increment `writeIndex`.
4.  After this loop, all non-zero elements have been moved to the front, and the zeroes have been moved to the back.

This is a classic "sliding window" problem. The goal is to find the length of the longest contiguous substring within a given string that contains no repeating characters.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A sliding window approach with a \`Set\` is efficient.
1.  **Initialize**: Set \`left = 0\`, \`maxLength = 0\`, and an empty \`Set\` called \`seen\` to store the characters in the current window.
2.  **Expand Window**: Loop through the string with a \`right\` pointer from 0 to the end.
3.  **Check for Duplicates**: For each character \`str[right]\`, use a \`while\` loop to check if it's already in the \`seen\` set.
    - If it is, it means we have a duplicate. We must shrink the window from the left by deleting \`str[left]\` from the \`seen\` set and incrementing \`left\` until the duplicate is removed.
4.  **Add Character**: Add the current character \`str[right]\` to the \`seen\` set.
5.  **Update Max Length**: The current window \`[left, right]\` is now guaranteed to have no duplicates. Update \`maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1)\`.

This is a very common interview question. Given an array of integers, you need to find the indices of two numbers that add up to a specific target value.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A brute-force solution would use nested loops, which is O(n^2). A much more efficient O(n) solution uses a hash map.
1.  **Initialize Map**: Create an empty \`Map\` to store numbers we've seen and their indices.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through the array with index \`i\`.
3.  **Calculate Complement**: For each number \`nums[i]\`, calculate the "complement" needed to reach the target: \`complement = target - nums[i]\`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
You are given an array of heights representing vertical lines. The goal is to find two lines that, along with the x-axis, form a container that can hold the most water. The area of a container is \`width * height\`. The width is the distance between the lines, and the height is limited by the shorter of the two lines.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient O(n) solution uses the two-pointer technique.
1.  **Initialize**: Set a \`left\` pointer at the beginning and a \`right\` pointer at the end of the array. Initialize \`maxArea = 0\`.
2.  **Loop**: Use a \`while\` loop that continues as long as \`left < right\`.
3.  **Calculate Area**:
    - \`width = right - left\`.
    - \`height = Math.min(heights[left], heights[right])\`.
    - \`area = width * height\`.
    - Update \`maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area)\`.
4.  **Move Pointer**: This is the key insight. To have a chance of finding a larger area, we must move the pointer that points to the *shorter* of the two walls. Moving the taller wall's pointer will always result in a smaller or equal area, because the width will decrease and the height will be limited by the same short wall.
    - If \`heights[left] < heights[right]\`, increment \`left\`.
    - Otherwise, decrement \`right\`.
5.  Return \`maxArea\`.

1. `maxEndingHere`: The maximum sum of a subarray ending at the current position.
2. `maxSoFar`: The overall maximum sum found anywhere in the array so far.

The logic for each element `num` is:
- `maxEndingHere = Math.max(num, maxEndingHere + num)`. This decides whether it's better to start a new subarray at the current element or to extend the previous subarray.
- `maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere)`. This updates the overall best sum found.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient solution involves sorting the array first and then using a two-pointer approach.
1. **Sort**: Sort the input array `nums`. This makes it easy to handle duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.
2. **Outer Loop**: Loop through the array with an index `i`. This `nums[i]` will be the first number in a potential triplet.
3. **Handle Duplicates**: If `nums[i]` is the same as `nums[i-1]`, skip it to avoid generating duplicate triplets.
4. **Two-Pointer Approach**: For each `nums[i]`, use a `left` pointer (starting at `i+1`) and a `right` pointer (starting at the end of the array) to find two other numbers that sum to `-nums[i]`.
   - While `left < right`:
     - If the sum is too small, move `left` pointer up.
     - If the sum is too large, move `right` pointer down.
     - If the sum is zero, you've found a triplet. Add it to the results. Then, move both pointers inward, making sure to skip any duplicate numbers to avoid duplicate triplets.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A two-pass approach is very efficient and meets the no-division constraint.
1. **Initialize**: Create a `result` array of the same size, filled with 1s.
2. **Left-to-Right Pass (Prefix Products)**:
   - Initialize a `prefix` product variable to 1.
   - Loop through the array from left to right.
   - For each index `i`, set `result[i] = prefix`.
   - Then, update `prefix` by multiplying it with `nums[i]`.
   - After this pass, `result[i]` will contain the product of all elements to the left of `i`.
3. **Right-to-Left Pass (Postfix Products)**:
   - Initialize a `postfix` product variable to 1.

2. **Loop**: Iterate through each character of the string.
3. **Logic**:
   - If the character is an **opening** bracket (a key in our map), push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a **closing** bracket:
     - The stack cannot be empty (there must be an opening bracket to match). If it is, return `false`.
     - Pop the last opening bracket from the stack.
     - Check if the current closing bracket is the correct match for the popped opening bracket (using the map). If not, return `false`.
4. **Final Check**: After the loop, if the stack is empty, it means every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unclosed opening brackets. Return `stack.length === 0`.

   - **Go Down**: Loop from `top` to `bottom`, adding `matrix[i][right]` to the result. Then, move the `right` boundary in (`right--`).
   - **Go Left**: Loop from `right` to `left` (backwards), adding `matrix[bottom][i]` to the result. Then, move the `bottom` boundary up (`bottom--`). Check `top <= bottom` before this step to handle single-row matrices.
   - **Go Up**: Loop from `bottom` to `top` (backwards), adding `matrix[i][left]` to the result. Then, move the `left` boundary in (`left++`). Check `left <= right` before this step to handle single-column matrices.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A clever two-step process can achieve this in-place.
1. **Transpose the Matrix**: First, transpose the matrix. A transposition swaps the element at `(r, c)` with the element at `(c, r)`. This can be done by iterating through the upper triangle of the matrix and swapping `matrix[r][c]` with `matrix[c][r]`.
2. **Reverse Each Row**: After transposing, reverse each individual row of the matrix.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A naive approach of immediately setting rows/columns to zero when a zero is found will cause issues, as these new zeros will then cause other rows/columns to be zeroed out. An O(m+n) space solution is straightforward:
1. **First Pass (Identify)**: Create two `Set`s, `zeroRows` and `zeroCols`. Iterate through the entire matrix. If `matrix[r][c]` is 0, add `r` to `zeroRows` and `c` to `zeroCols`.
2. **Second Pass (Modify)**: Iterate through the matrix again. If the current row `r` is in the `zeroRows` set or the current column `c` is in the `zeroCols` set, set `matrix[r][c]` to 0.

An O(1) space solution is also possible. It involves using the first row and first column of the matrix itself as storage to mark which rows/columns need to be zeroed, with a couple of extra variables to handle the state of the first row/column themselves.

This is a classic backtracking problem. Given a grid of characters, you need to find if a given `word` can be formed by starting at any cell and moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), without reusing a cell in the same path.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution uses Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking.
1. **Outer Loops**: Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid. If a cell matches the first letter of the `word`, start a DFS from there.
2. **DFS Helper Function `dfs(r, c, k)`**: This recursive function checks if the rest of the word (from index `k`) can be found starting at `(r, c)`.
   - **Base Cases**:
     - If `(r, c)` is out of bounds or the character at `grid[r][c]` doesn't match `word[k]`, this path fails, so return `false`.
     - If `k` reaches the end of the word, it means we've successfully matched all characters, so return `true`.
   - **Backtracking**:
     - To avoid reusing a cell, temporarily "mark" the current cell `(r, c)` as visited (e.g., by changing its character to a special symbol like `#`).
     - Make recursive calls to `dfs` for all four neighbors. If any of these calls return `true`, it means a path was found, so return `true`.
     - **"Un-mark"** the cell by restoring its original character. This is the crucial backtracking step, allowing the cell to be used in other potential paths.
   - If none of the recursive calls find a path, return `false`.

The sliding window approach uses two pointers, \`left\` and \`right\`, to define the current window.
1.  **Frequency Map**: First, create a frequency map of the characters in the target string \`T\`.
2.  **Expand Window**: Start with both pointers at the beginning. Move the \`right\` pointer to expand the window. As you do, update a count of the required characters that are now in your current window.
3.  **Check for Validity**: Once the window contains all the required characters from \`T\`, it is a "valid" window.
4.  **Shrink Window**: Now, try to find a smaller valid window. Move the \`left\` pointer inward. As long as the window remains valid, keep shrinking it and updating the minimum window size found so far.
5.  **Repeat**: Once the window becomes invalid (by shrinking it too much), go back to step 2 and start expanding the \`right\` pointer again. Continue until the \`right\` pointer reaches the end of the string.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Sliding Window**: An algorithmic pattern using two pointers to maintain a "window" over a data set. It's very efficient for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- **Frequency Map (Hash Map)**: Essential for keeping track of the character counts needed and the counts within the current window.

  'as-trapping-rain-water': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a challenging but classic interview problem. Given an array of heights representing an elevation map, you need to calculate the total volume of rainwater that can be trapped between the bars after a rainfall. The amount of water above any bar is limited by the height of the shortest of the two tallest walls to its left and right.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient O(n) solution uses the two-pointer technique.
1.  **Initialize**: Set a \`left\` pointer at the beginning and a \`right\` pointer at the end. Initialize \`leftMax\` and \`rightMax\` heights to 0. These will track the tallest bar seen so far from each side.
2.  **Loop**: Use a \`while\` loop that continues as long as \`left < right\`.
3.  **Process Shorter Wall**:
    - If \`heights[left]\` is shorter than \`heights[right]\`, the water level at this position is determined by \`leftMax\`. Update \`leftMax\` if the current wall is taller. The water trapped is \`leftMax - heights[left]\`. Add this to the total. Move the \`left\` pointer inward.
    - Otherwise, do the symmetric operations for the right side: update \`rightMax\`, calculate trapped water (\`rightMax - heights[right]\`), and move the \`right\` pointer inward.
4.  Return the total water after the loop finishes.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: The key insight is that the water level at any point is limited by the shorter of the maximum walls to its left and right. The two-pointer approach efficiently tracks these maximums as it moves inward.

  'as-text-justification': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a very challenging string manipulation and formatting problem. You are given an array of words and a max width. You must format the text into lines of that exact width by adding extra spaces between words. The last line should be left-justified.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The approach is greedy. You process the text line by line.
1.  **Gather Words for a Line**: In a loop, gather as many words as can fit on a single line (considering one space between them).
2.  **Justify the Line**: Once you have the words for a line, calculate the total number of spaces needed.
    - Calculate the number of "gaps" between words.
    - Distribute the spaces as evenly as possible into these gaps. Any extra spaces should be added to the gaps on the left side first.
    - Build the justified line string.
3.  **Handle the Last Line**: The last line is a special case. It should be left-justified, meaning only one space between words and extra spaces added at the end to reach the max width.
4.  Repeat until all words are processed.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Greedy Algorithm**: At each step, we make the locally optimal choice by fitting as many words as possible onto the current line.
- **String Formatting**: Complex logic for building strings with precise spacing.

  'as-roman-to-integer': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to convert a Roman numeral string (e.g., "MCMXCIV") into its integer equivalent (1994). The key challenge is handling the subtractive notation where a smaller value before a larger one means subtraction (e.g., "IV" is 4, not 6).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A single pass through the string from left to right can solve this.
1. Create a map of Roman numeral characters to their integer values.
2. Initialize `total` to 0.
3. Loop through the string. For each character `current`, also look at the next character `next`.
   - If `next` exists and its value is greater than `current`'s value, it's a subtractive case. Add `next_value - current_value` to the total and skip the next character (increment the loop counter by an extra 1).
   - Otherwise, just add the `current` value to the total.

A simpler logic is to iterate left-to-right and if `current < next`, subtract `current` from the total. Otherwise, add `current`.
\`\`\`javascript
let total = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < roman.length; i++) {
    const currentVal = map[roman[i]];
    const nextVal = map[roman[i+1]];

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the reverse of the previous problem: converting an integer into its Roman numeral string representation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A greedy approach is effective. We want to subtract the largest possible Roman numeral value from our number at each step.
1. Create two parallel arrays: one with the integer values in descending order, and one with the corresponding Roman numeral symbols. Crucially, include the subtractive cases (e.g., 900 for "CM", 40 for "XL").
2. Initialize an empty `result` string.
3. Loop through the `values` array.
4. For each value, use a `while` loop: as long as the input `num` is greater than or equal to the current value, append the corresponding symbol to the `result` and subtract the value from `num`.
5. Continue until `num` becomes 0.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Greedy Algorithm**: At each step, we greedily subtract the largest possible symbol value, which leads to the correct representation.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the longest string that is a prefix (starting part) of every string in an array of strings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple and effective approach is "vertical scanning."
1.  If the array is empty, return "".
2.  Iterate through the characters of the *first* string in the array (using an index \`i\`).
3.  For each character \`char\` at index \`i\`, loop through *all the other strings* in the array.
4.  Check if the character at index \`i\` in the other strings is the same as \`char\`.
5.  If a mismatch is found, or if one of the other strings is shorter than index \`i\`, it means the common prefix ends at the previous character. Return the substring of the first string up to that point.
6.  If the outer loop completes, the entire first string is the common prefix.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Prefix**: A sequence of characters at the beginning of a string.
- **Nested Loops**: Used to compare characters at the same position across all strings in the array.

  'as-implement-strstr': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem asks you to implement the functionality of the standard library function `strstr()` (or `.indexOf()` in JavaScript). You need to find the first occurrence of a "needle" string within a "haystack" string and return its starting index. If the needle is not found, return -1.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The most straightforward solution is to use the built-in `String.prototype.indexOf()` method, as it does exactly this.
\`\`\`javascript
function strStr(haystack, needle) {
  return haystack.indexOf(needle);
}
\`\`\`
If you were to implement it manually, you would loop through the `haystack` and, for each position, check if the substring starting at that position matches the `needle`.

  'as-merge-sorted-arrays': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
You are given two sorted arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`. `nums1` has enough empty space at the end to hold all the elements of `nums2`. The task is to merge `nums2` into `nums1` to create a single sorted array, modifying `nums1` in-place.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A common mistake is to merge from the beginning, which requires shifting elements constantly. The efficient solution is to merge from the **end** of the arrays backwards.
1. **Initialize Pointers**:
   - `i`: points to the last *actual* element in `nums1` (`m-1`).
   - `j`: points to the last element in `nums2` (`n-1`).
   - `k`: points to the last position in the combined `nums1` array (`m+n-1`).
2. **Loop**: Use a `while` loop that continues as long as there are elements left in `nums2` (`j >= 0`).
3. **Compare and Place**: In each iteration, compare `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]`.
   - Place the larger of the two at `nums1[k]`.
   - Decrement the pointer (`i` or `j`) of the element you just placed.
   - Decrement `k`.
4. The loop automatically handles cases where one array is exhausted before the other.

### üìö Key Concepts

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a variation of the "Remove Duplicates" problem. Given a sorted array, you must remove duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears at most *twice*.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient solution uses a "write pointer" (`i`) to manage the modified part of the array.
1. **Edge Case**: If the array has 2 or fewer elements, no duplicates need to be removed.
2. **Initialize Write Pointer**: Set `i = 2`.
3. **Loop**: Iterate through the array with a "read pointer" `j`, starting from index 2.
4. **Check Condition**: The core logic is to check if the current element `nums[j]` is different from the element at `i-2`. If `nums[j] !== nums[i-2]`, it means we are not creating a sequence of more than two identical numbers.
   - If the condition is true, it's safe to place `nums[j]` at the `i`-th position: `nums[i] = nums[j]`.
   - Increment `i`.
5. The final value of `i` is the new length of the array.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
You are given an array of digits representing a large integer. The task is to increment this integer by one and return the new array of digits.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is to iterate through the array from right to left, simulating grade-school addition with a "carry".
1. Loop from the last digit to the first.
2. In each iteration:
   - If the current digit is less than 9, simply increment it by one and return the array immediately. The process is done.
   - If the current digit is 9, set it to 0 and continue the loop to handle the "carry-over" to the next digit to the left.
3. **Edge Case**: If the loop finishes (meaning all digits were 9, like in `[9, 9]`), it means you need to add a new leading 1. Use `.unshift(1)` to add a 1 to the beginning of the array.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Array Manipulation**: The problem is solved by iterating and modifying an array in-place.
- **Edge Case Handling**: The case where all digits are 9 needs to be handled specifically.

The task is to rotate the elements of an array to the right by `k` steps in-place. For example, rotating `[1,2,3,4,5]` by 2 steps results in `[4,5,1,2,3]`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A clever and efficient in-place solution uses three array reversals.
1. **Normalize `k`**: First, take `k` modulo the array's length to handle cases where `k` is larger than the array size.
2. **Reverse the entire array**: Reverse all elements. `[1,2,3,4,5]` becomes `[5,4,3,2,1]`.
3. **Reverse the first `k` elements**: Reverse the subarray from index 0 to `k-1`. `[5,4,3,2,1]` becomes `[4,5,3,2,1]`.
4. **Reverse the remaining elements**: Reverse the subarray from index `k` to the end. `[4,5,3,2,1]` becomes `[4,5,1,2,3]`.
This three-step reversal process correctly rotates the array.

  'as-longest-palindromic-substring': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. The task is to find the longest contiguous substring of a given string that is also a palindrome.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A common and intuitive approach is "Expand from Center."
1. Iterate through every character in the string. For each character, treat it as the potential "center" of a palindrome.
2. **Two Cases**: A palindrome can have an odd length (like "racecar", centered at 'e') or an even length (like "aabbaa", centered between the two 'b's). So, for each index `i`, we need to check both cases:
   - **Odd Length**: Expand outwards from the center `i`.
   - **Even Length**: Expand outwards from the "center" `i` and `i+1`.
3. **Expand Function**: Create a helper function that takes a center `left` and `right` index. Use a `while` loop to expand outwards as long as the pointers are in bounds and the characters match. Return the palindromic substring found.
4. **Track Longest**: In the main loop, keep track of the longest palindromic substring found so far.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Programming**: While "Expand from Center" is more intuitive, a formal DP solution with a 2D table is also possible.
- **Palindrome Properties**: The solution leverages the symmetric nature of palindromes.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to simulate writing a string in a zigzag pattern across a specified number of rows and then reading it out line by line.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution involves creating an array of strings, where each string represents a row. We then iterate through the input string, appending each character to the correct row.
1. **Initialize**: Create an array of empty strings, with the size equal to `numRows`.
2. **Control Flow**: We need a way to track which row we're on (`currentRow`) and whether our direction is "going down" or "going up". A boolean flag `goingDown` can be used for this.
3. **Loop**: Iterate through each character of the input string.
   - Append the character to the string at `rows[currentRow]`.
   - **Change Direction**: If we are at the top row (`currentRow === 0`) or the bottom row (`currentRow === numRows - 1`), flip the `goingDown` flag.
   - **Move**: Update `currentRow` by adding 1 if `goingDown` is true, or subtracting 1 if it's false.
4. **Join**: After the loop, join the strings in the `rows` array to get the final result.

  'as-string-to-integer-atoi': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic parsing problem. The goal is to implement a function that converts a string to an integer, similar to the C \`atoi\` function. The function needs to handle several rules:
1.  Discard leading whitespace.
2.  Handle an optional leading sign (\`+\` or \`-\`).
3.  Read in digits until a non-digit character is encountered.
4.  Handle values that are outside the 32-bit signed integer range.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The built-in \`parseInt()\` function handles the first three rules perfectly. The main task is to clamp the result to the 32-bit integer range.
\`\`\`javascript
function myAtoi(s) {

  if (num > INT_MAX) return INT_MAX;
  if (num < INT_MIN) return INT_MIN;
  
  return num;

\`\`\`
1.  **\`parseInt(s.trim(), 10)\`**: This trims whitespace and parses the integer. \`parseInt\` automatically handles signs and stops at the first non-digit character.
2.  **Range Clamping**: The result is compared against the \`INT_MAX\` and \`INT_MIN\` constants and adjusted if it falls outside the range.

A greedy approach provides an efficient O(n) solution. We keep track of the `farthest` index we can possibly reach at any point.
1. Initialize `farthest = 0`.
2. Loop through the array with an index `i`.
3. **Check Reachability**: In each iteration, first check if the current index `i` is beyond the `farthest` point we could have reached. If `i > farthest`, it means we are stuck and can never reach the end, so return `false`.
4. **Update Farthest**: Update the `farthest` reachable point from the current position: `farthest = Math.max(farthest, i + nums[i])`.
5. If the loop completes, it means we were never stuck and could always advance. Therefore, the end is reachable. Return `true`.

You are given an array where the numbers are in the range \`[1, n]\` (where \`n\` is the size of the array). The task is to find all numbers that appear twice. This can be solved cleverly in O(n) time and without using extra space.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution uses the array itself as a hash map by manipulating the signs of the numbers.
1.  Iterate through the array.
2.  For each number \`num\`, consider the index it corresponds to: \`index = Math.abs(num) - 1\`.
3.  Go to the element at that index, \`nums[index]\`.
4.  If the element at \`nums[index]\` is already negative, it means we have seen the number \`Math.abs(num)\` before. Add it to our duplicates list.
5.  If it's positive, "mark" it as seen by negating it: \`nums[index] = -nums[index]\`.

This works because we use the sign of the number at an index to store the "seen" state for the number corresponding to that index.

The algorithm involves a few steps, scanning from the right:
1.  **Find the Pivot**: Find the first element from the right (\`nums[i]\`) which is smaller than the element to its right (\`nums[i+1]\`). This is our "pivot."
2.  **Find the Swap Element**: Find the smallest element to the right of the pivot (\`nums[j]\`) that is still larger than the pivot.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A standard binary search won't work directly, but it can be modified. The key is that in any rotated sorted array, at least one of the two halves (from `left` to `mid`, or from `mid` to `right`) must still be sorted.
1. Use a `while` loop for binary search.
2. In each iteration, find the `mid` point.
3. Check if the left half (`nums[left]` to `nums[mid]`) is the sorted half.
   - If it is, check if the `target` lies within the range of this sorted half.
   - If yes, search in the left half. If no, search in the right half.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
Given a set of candidate numbers (which can be reused) and a target, find all unique combinations that sum up to the target.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a backtracking problem similar to "Combinations," but with a few key differences.
1. **`backtrack(currentCombination, remainingSum, start)`**:
   - **Base Case (Success)**: If `remainingSum === 0`, we have found a valid combination.
   - **Base Case (Failure)**: If `remainingSum < 0`, this path is invalid.
   - **Recursive Step**: Loop through the `candidates` starting from the `start` index.
     - "Choose" the candidate `candidates[i]` by adding it to the current combination.
     - Make a recursive call. Crucially, the `start` index passed to the next call is `i`, not `i+1`. This is what allows us to reuse the same number.
     - "Un-choose" by popping the candidate from the combination.

### üìö Key Concepts

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a variation where the candidate numbers may contain duplicates, and each number can only be used once in each combination.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This combines the logic from "Combinations" and "Permutations II."
1. **Sort**: Sort the `candidates` array to handle duplicates easily.
2. **`backtrack(currentCombination, remainingSum, start)`**:
   - **Recursive Step Loop**:
     - **Skip Duplicates**: Add a condition: if `i > start` and `candidates[i] === candidates[i-1]`, skip this iteration. This prevents creating duplicate combinations that use the same numbers in a different order.
     - "Choose" `candidates[i]`.
     - Make a recursive call with `start` index `i + 1` (because each number can only be used once).

A backtracking approach is very clear.
1. **`backtrack(currentSubset, start)`**:
   - **Add to Results**: First, add a copy of the `currentSubset` to the main results list. This is because every state in our exploration (`[]`, `[1]`, `[1, 2]`, etc.) is a valid subset.

The task is to take a 2D array (matrix) and reshape it into new dimensions (`r` rows and `c` columns), preserving the original order of the elements. If the reshape is not possible (i.e., the number of elements doesn't match), the original matrix should be returned.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. **Validation**: Check if the reshape is possible. The number of elements in the original matrix (`original_rows * original_cols`) must equal `r * c`. If not, return the original matrix.

A Toeplitz matrix is a special kind of matrix where every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements. The task is to check if a given matrix has this property.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The property can be checked with a single pass using nested loops. The condition is that for any element `matrix[r][c]`, it must be equal to the element to its bottom-right, `matrix[r+1][c+1]`.
1. **Loop**: Use nested loops to iterate through every element of the matrix. The loops should stop one row and one column early to avoid going out of bounds.
2. **Compare**: For each element `matrix[r][c]`, compare it with `matrix[r+1][c+1]`.
3. **Return \`false\`**: If at any point they are not equal, the matrix is not Toeplitz, so you can return \`false\` immediately.
4. **Return \`true\`**: If the loops complete without finding any mismatches, the matrix is Toeplitz.

A "mountain array" has specific properties:
1. It must have a length of at least 3.
2. There must be a "peak" index where the array is strictly increasing before the peak and strictly decreasing after the peak.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A single pass with a pointer (`i`) can validate the array.
1. **Walk Up**: Use a `while` loop to walk up the "mountain" as long as the array is strictly increasing (`arr[i] < arr[i+1]`).
2. **Check Peak**: After the loop, check if the peak is valid. The peak cannot be the first or last element, so `i` must be greater than 0 and less than `n-1`. If not, return `false`.
3. **Walk Down**: Use another `while` loop to walk down the rest of the mountain as long as it's strictly decreasing (`arr[i] > arr[i+1]`).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A two-pointer approach is efficient for this in-place sort.
1. **Initialize**: Set a `left` pointer at the start and a `right` pointer at the end of the array.
2. **Loop**: Use a `while` loop that continues as long as `left < right`.
3. **Compare and Swap**: If `nums[left]` is odd and `nums[right]` is even, swap them.
4. **Move Pointers**:
   - If `nums[left]` is even, move the `left` pointer forward.
   - If `nums[right]` is odd, move the `right` pointer backward.

Given an array that is sorted (but may contain negative numbers), the task is to create a new array containing the square of each number, also in sorted order.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The naive approach is to map each number to its square and then sort the result. This works but has a time complexity of O(n log n). An O(n) solution is possible with the two-pointer technique because the original array is sorted.
1. The largest squared numbers will be at the ends of the original array (e.g., -10 and 10).
2. **Initialize**: Set a `left` pointer at the start and a `right` pointer at the end. Create a `result` array of the same size.
3. **Loop**: Loop from the *end* of the `result` array backwards.
4. **Compare and Place**: In each iteration, compare the absolute value of the number at `left` with the number at `right`.
   - The larger of the two, when squared, will be the next largest number in the result.
   - Square this larger number and place it at the current position in the `result` array.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A `Set` can be used to efficiently find the pairs.
1. Handle the edge case `k < 0` (return 0).
2. Create two `Set`s: `seen` to store the numbers we have iterated over, and `pairs` to store the starting number of each unique pair we find.
3. Loop through the array. For each `num`:
   - Check if `seen.has(num - k)`. If it does, we've found a pair. Add `num - k` to the `pairs` set.
   - Check if `seen.has(num + k)`. If it does, we've found a pair. Add `num` to the `pairs` set.
   - Add the current `num` to the `seen` set.

  'as-isomorphic-strings': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Two strings are "isomorphic" if there's a one-to-one mapping between their characters. For example, "egg" and "add" are isomorphic because \`e -> a\` and \`g -> d\`. However, "foo" and "bar" are not, because \`o\` would have to map to both \`a\` and \`r\`. "badc" and "baba" are not, because \`d\` and \`b\` would both map to \`a\`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The key is to ensure a consistent, bijective (two-way) mapping. This can be checked using two maps.
1. Initialize two maps: `s_to_t` and `t_to_s`.
2. Loop through the strings by index `i`.
3. For each pair of characters `s[i]` and `t[i]`:
   - Check the forward mapping: If `s[i]` is already in `s_to_t` but maps to something different than `t[i]`, return `false`.
   - Check the backward mapping: If `t[i]` is already in `t_to_s` but maps to something different than `s[i]`, return `false`.
   - If the mappings are consistent (or new), update both maps.

1. Split the sentence `s` into an array of `words`. Check if the length of the `pattern` and the `words` array are equal. If not, return `false`.
2. Initialize two maps: `pattern_to_word` and `word_to_pattern`.
3. Loop by index `i`.

A "happy number" is determined by a process: repeatedly sum the squares of a number's digits. If this process reaches 1, the number is happy. If it enters a cycle without reaching 1, it's not happy. The task is to determine if a number is happy.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The key to solving this is detecting if we've entered a cycle. A `Set` can be used to keep track of the numbers we've already seen in the sequence.
1. Initialize a `Set` called `seen`.
2. Use a `while` loop that continues as long as the number `n` is not 1 and has not been seen before.
3. Inside the loop:
   - Add the current `n` to the `seen` set.
   - Calculate the sum of the squares of its digits and assign this new sum back to `n`.
4. After the loop, check why it terminated. If `n === 1`, the number is happy. Otherwise, it must have terminated because a cycle was detected.

2. **Initialize Window**: Create a frequency map for the initial window in \`s\` (the first \`p.length\` characters).
3. **Slide and Compare**: Loop from \`p.length\` to the end of \`s\`. In each step:
   - **Compare**: Check if the current window's frequency map matches the pattern's frequency map. If so, add the start index of the window to the results.
   - **Slide**: "Slide" the window one position to the right by:
     - Adding the new character at the end of the window to the window's frequency map.
     - Removing the character that just left the window from the window's frequency map.
4. Remember to check the last window after the loop finishes.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Sliding Window**: An efficient technique for problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- **Frequency Counting**: Used to determine if a substring is an anagram of the pattern.

  'as-pascals-triangle-row': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to generate a specific row (rowIndex) of Pascal's Triangle without necessarily generating all the rows before it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
We can build the row iteratively. Each element in a row of Pascal's Triangle can be calculated from the previous element in the same row using a mathematical formula based on combinations: \`C(n, k) = C(n, k-1) * (n - k + 1) / k\`.
1. Initialize a \`row\` array with the first element, \`[1]\`.
2. Loop from \`k = 1\` up to the \`rowIndex\`.
3. In each iteration, calculate the next element in the row using the formula and the previously calculated element \`row[k-1]\`.
4. Push the new element into the \`row\` array.
5. Return the completed \`row\`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a variation of the stock profit problem. Here, you can complete as many transactions as you like (buy one day, sell another; repeat). The goal is to maximize the total profit.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple greedy approach works perfectly. The key insight is that you can capture the profit from every "uphill" price movement.
1. Initialize \`maxProfit\` to 0.
2. Loop through the \`prices\` array starting from the second day (\`i = 1\`).
3. In each iteration, compare the price of the current day (\`prices[i]\`) with the price of the previous day (\`prices[i-1]\`).
4. If today's price is higher, it means there was a profit to be made. Add that difference (\`prices[i] - prices[i-1]\`) to \`maxProfit\`.
5. This is equivalent to buying on every "valley" and selling on the next "peak".

### üìö Key Concepts

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to convert an Excel column title (like "A", "B", ..., "Z", "AA", "AB") into its corresponding column number (1, 2, ..., 26, 27, 28). This is essentially a base-26 number system conversion.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution iterates through the column title string from left to right.
1. Initialize \`result\` to 0.
2. For each character in the string:
   - Multiply the current \`result\` by 26 (to shift to the next place value).
   - Get the character's numeric value (A=1, B=2, ...) by using its character code. \`char.charCodeAt(0) - 64\` works for uppercase letters.
   - Add this value to the \`result\`.
\`\`\`javascript
// For "ZY"
// Iteration 1 (Z): result = 0 * 26 + 26 = 26

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the reverse of the previous problem: converting a column number into its Excel title string. This is like converting from base-10 to a modified base-26 system.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The logic is similar to standard base conversion, but with a twist because Excel columns are 1-indexed (A=1) not 0-indexed.
1. Use a \`while\` loop that continues as long as the \`columnNumber\` is greater than 0.
2. Inside the loop:
   - Decrement the number by 1 to handle the 1-based indexing.
   - Calculate the remainder when divided by 26. This gives the 0-25 value for the next character. Convert this to a character (A-Z).
   - Prepend this character to the result string.
   - Update the \`columnNumber\` by dividing it by 26 and flooring it.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
Given an array where every number appears twice except for one, the task is to find that single unique number.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A very elegant and efficient solution uses the bitwise XOR (\`^\`) operator. XOR has two key properties:
1. \`x ^ x = 0\` (XORing a number with itself results in zero).
2. \`x ^ 0 = x\` (XORing a number with zero results in the number itself).

If you XOR all the numbers in the array together, all the paired numbers will cancel each other out (\`n ^ n = 0\`), leaving only the unique number.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to check if an integer is a palindrome. A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward (e.g., 121). A key constraint is often to do this without converting the number to a string.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution involves mathematically reversing the number and comparing it to the original.
1. Handle edge cases: Negative numbers are not palindromes. Numbers ending in 0 (except 0 itself) cannot be palindromes.
2. Initialize `reversed = 0`.
3. Use a `while` loop to reverse the second half of the number.
   - In each iteration, take the last digit of the original number (`n % 10`).
   - Append it to `reversed`.
   - Remove the last digit from the original number (`Math.floor(n / 10)`).
4. The loop stops when `reversed` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
5. Compare `n` and `reversed`. They are equal if the number has an even number of digits. If it has an odd number, the middle digit will be left on `n`, so we also check if `n` equals `Math.floor(reversed / 10)`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple and efficient solution uses a "write pointer".
1. Initialize a write pointer `i` to 0.
2. Loop through the array with a read pointer `j`.
3. If the element at `nums[j]` is **not** equal to the value to be removed:
   - Copy the element `nums[j]` to the position `nums[i]`.
   - Increment the write pointer `i`.
4. After the loop, the first `i` elements of the array will be the elements that were not removed. Return `i`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The standard binary search algorithm can be used.
1. Initialize \`left\` and \`right\` pointers to the start and end of the array.
2. Loop while \`left <= right\`.
3. Find the \`mid\` index.
   - If \`nums[mid]\` is the target, return \`mid\`.
   - If \`nums[mid]\` is less than the target, the insertion point must be to the right, so set \`left = mid + 1\`.
   - If \`nums[mid]\` is greater than the target, the insertion point could be \`mid\` or to its left, so set \`right = mid - 1\`.
4. If the loop finishes, the target was not found. The \`left\` pointer will be at the correct insertion position. Return \`left\`.

  'as-battleships-in-board': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to count the number of battleships on a grid. A battleship is a contiguous line of 'X's (either horizontal or vertical). A key rule is that battleships are separated by at least one empty cell ('.'), so they never touch.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The "no-touching" rule allows for a very simple solution. We only need to count the "heads" of the battleships. A cell \`(r, c)\` containing an 'X' is the head of a battleship if there is no 'X' to its immediate left and no 'X' immediately above it.
1. Initialize \`count = 0\`.
2. Use nested loops to iterate through every cell \`(r, c)\`.
3. If the cell contains an 'X':
   - Check if \`r === 0\` or the cell above (\`board[r-1][c]\`) is a '.'.
   - Check if \`c === 0\` or the cell to the left (\`board[r][c-1]\`) is a '.'.

A two-pass approach is efficient and easy to understand.
1. **Initialize**: Create a \`result\` array of the same size, filled with a large number (\`Infinity\`).
2. **Left-to-Right Pass**: Loop through the string from left to right.
   - Keep track of the index of the most recently seen target character, \`pos\`.
   - If the current character is the target, update \`pos\`.
   - Set \`result[i]\` to \`i - pos\`. This will correctly calculate the distance for all characters to the right of a target character.
3. **Right-to-Left Pass**: Now, loop through the string from right to left.
   - Again, keep track of the most recent \`pos\` of the target character.
   - Set \`result[i]\` to the *minimum* of its current value and the new distance \`Math.abs(i - pos)\`. This pass corrects the distances for all characters to the left of a target character.

1. **Initialize**: Create a stack, and set the current number (\`num\`) to 0 and the last operator (\`lastOp\`) to '+'.
2. **Loop**: Iterate through the string.
   - If the character is a digit, update \`num\`.
   - If the character is an operator (or we are at the end of the string), we need to process the previous \`num\` based on the \`lastOp\`.
     - If \`lastOp\` was '+': push \`num\` onto the stack.
     - If \`lastOp\` was '-': push \`-num\` onto the stack.

2. Expand the window with a `right` pointer. Update the frequency of the character at `s[right]`. Keep track of the frequency of the most common character in the current window.
3. **Check Validity**: After expanding, check if the window is valid using the formula `(right - left + 1) - maxFrequency <= k`.
4. **Shrink Window**: If the window is *not* valid, shrink it from the left by decrementing the frequency of the character at `s[left]` and incrementing the `left` pointer.
5. The length of the longest valid window found is the answer.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic graph traversal problem on a 2D grid. An "island" is a group of connected '1's (land). The task is to count how many distinct islands there are.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is to iterate through the grid. Whenever we find a '1' that we haven't visited yet, we know we've found a new island. We then increment our island count and use a traversal algorithm (like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) to find all parts of that same island, marking them as "visited" so we don't count them again.
1. Initialize `islandCount = 0`.
2. Use nested loops to iterate through every cell `(r, c)`.
3. If `grid[r][c]` is '1':
   - Increment `islandCount`.
   - Start a traversal (e.g., a recursive DFS) from `(r, c)`.
   - In the traversal, change every '1' you visit to a different character (e.g., '#') to mark it as visited. The traversal should explore up, down, left, and right.

1. Create two arrays: one for all `start` times and one for all `end` times.
2. **Sort**: Sort both arrays in ascending order.
3. **Initialize**: Set `rooms = 0`, and use two pointers: `startPointer` and `endPointer`.
4. **Loop**: Iterate through the `start` times array with the `startPointer`.
   - In each iteration, we are "scheduling" a new meeting. Increment `rooms`.
   - Now, check if any previous meetings have ended by the time this new one starts. Compare the current `start` time with the time at the `endPointer`.
   - If `start_times[startPointer] >= end_times[endPointer]`, it means a room has freed up. Decrement `rooms` and advance the `endPointer`.
5. The answer is the maximum value that `rooms` reached during the process. A simpler way is to just keep track of the count and not decrement.

A Min-Heap based solution is also common and very intuitive.

  'as-merge-intervals': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to take an array of intervals `[[start, end], ...]` and merge any that overlap. For example, `[[1,3],[2,6]]` should be merged into `[[1,6]]`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution involves sorting the intervals and then iterating through them to merge.
1. **Sort**: Sort the intervals array based on the start time of each interval. This is a crucial first step.
2. **Initialize**: Create a `merged` array and add the first interval from the sorted list to it.
3. **Loop**: Iterate through the rest of the sorted intervals.
4. **Compare and Merge**: For each interval, compare its start time with the end time of the *last* interval in the `merged` array.
   - If the current interval's start is less than or equal to the last merged interval's end, they overlap. Merge them by updating the end time of the last merged interval to be the maximum of the two end times.
   - If they don't overlap, simply push the current interval onto the `merged` array.
5. Return the `merged` array.

  'as-letter-case-permutation': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to generate all possible strings that can be created by changing the case of the letters in an input string. Digits should remain unchanged. For "a1b2", the results are "a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a classic backtracking problem. We can build the permutations recursively.
1. **`backtrack(index, currentString)`**:
   - **Base Case**: If `index` reaches the end of the string, we have a complete permutation. Add `currentString` to the results.
   - **Recursive Step**: Get the character at the current `index`.
     - If it's a digit, there's only one path. Append it to `currentString` and make a single recursive call for the next index.
     - If it's a letter, there are two paths. Make two recursive calls: one with the lowercase version of the letter appended, and one with the uppercase version appended.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the longest word in a dictionary that can be "built" one character at a time from other, shorter words in the same dictionary. For example, "world" is a valid answer if "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl" are also in the dictionary.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient solution uses a `Set` for fast lookups.
1. **Sort**: Sort the dictionary array. A good sort order is first by length (ascending) and then lexicographically.
2. **Initialize**: Create a `Set` called `validWords` to store words that can be built.
3. **Loop**: Iterate through the sorted `words`.
4. **Check**: For each `word`:
   - If the word has length 1, it's buildable by default.
   - Otherwise, check if the prefix of the word (the word minus its last character) exists in our `validWords` set.
   - If a word is buildable, add it to the `validWords` set and update the `longestWord` found so far.
5. Return the final `longestWord`.

A Trie-based solution is also very efficient.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. Given a string and a dictionary of words, you need to determine if the string can be completely segmented into a sequence of one or more words from the dictionary.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A bottom-up dynamic programming approach is efficient.
1. **Initialize**: Create a boolean array `dp` of size `s.length + 1`, initialized to `false`. Set `dp[0] = true`, which represents that an empty string can always be formed.
2. **Outer Loop**: Loop `i` from 1 to `s.length`. `dp[i]` will represent whether the substring `s.substring(0, i)` can be broken.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, loop `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
4. **Check**: Inside the inner loop, check two conditions:
   - Is `dp[j]` true? (Meaning the substring up to `j` can be broken).
   - Is the remaining part, `s.substring(j, i)`, a word in the dictionary?
5. **Update DP**: If both are true, it means we can form the string up to `i`. Set `dp[i] = true` and `break` the inner loop to move to the next `i`.
6. The final answer is the value of `dp[s.length]`.

### üìö Key Concepts

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a dynamic programming problem. Given an array of distinct integers and a target, you need to find the number of *permutations* of the numbers that sum up to the target. The order matters, so `(1, 2, 1)` and `(1, 1, 2)` are different combinations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A bottom-up dynamic programming approach is effective.
1. **Initialize**: Create a `dp` array of size `target + 1`, initialized to zeros. Set `dp[0] = 1` (there is one way to make a sum of 0: by choosing no numbers).
2. **Outer Loop**: Loop `i` from 1 to `target`. `dp[i]` will store the number of ways to make the sum `i`.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, loop through each `num` in the input `nums` array.
4. **Update DP**: If `i - num >= 0`, it means we can form the sum `i` by taking a combination that sums to `i - num` and adding `num` to it. So, we add the number of ways to make `i - num` to our current count for `i`: `dp[i] += dp[i - num]`.
5. The final answer is `dp[target]`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a classic dynamic programming problem. Given a set of coin denominations and an amount, the task is to find the *fewest* number of coins required to make that amount.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A bottom-up dynamic programming approach is standard.
1. **Initialize**: Create a `dp` array of size `amount + 1`. Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (0 coins are needed to make 0). Fill the rest of the array with a large value, like `Infinity`, to represent that these amounts are not yet reachable.
2. **Outer Loop**: Loop `i` from 1 to `amount`. `dp[i]` will store the minimum coins needed for amount `i`.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, loop through each `coin` in the `coins` array.
4. **Update DP**: If a `coin` is less than or equal to the current amount `i`, we can potentially use it. The number of coins would be `1 + dp[i - coin]` (1 for the current coin, plus the minimum coins needed for the remaining amount).
   - We update `dp[i]` to be the minimum of its current value and this new potential value: `dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], 1 + dp[i - coin])`.
5. The final answer is `dp[amount]`. If it's still `Infinity`, it means the amount cannot be made.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An O(n^2) dynamic programming solution is a good starting point.
1. **Initialize**: Create a `dp` array of the same size as the input, with all values initialized to 1. `dp[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that *ends* at index `i`.
2. **Outer Loop**: Loop `i` from 1 to the end of the array.
3. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, loop `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
4. **Update DP**: If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means we can potentially extend the subsequence that ends at `j`. We update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `1 + dp[j]`.
5. The final answer is the maximum value in the `dp` array.

An O(n log n) solution also exists, which is more advanced and involves maintaining a sorted list of the smallest tail elements for increasing subsequences of different lengths.

  'as-partition-equal-subset-sum': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine if an array can be partitioned into two subsets with an equal sum. This is a variation of the knapsack problem.
1. **Key Insight**: If the array can be partitioned this way, the sum of each subset must be `totalSum / 2`.
2. **Transformation**: The problem is transformed into: "Can we find a subset of the array that sums up to `totalSum / 2`?".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A dynamic programming approach can solve this.
1. **Calculate Total Sum**: Find the sum of all numbers. If the sum is odd, it's impossible to partition, so return `false`.
2. **Target Sum**: The target for our subset sum problem is `target = totalSum / 2`.
3. **DP State**: Create a `dp` set (or boolean array) to store all the possible sums that can be made using the numbers seen so far. Initialize it with `0`.
4. **Loop**: Iterate through each `num` in the input array.
   - For each `num`, create a new set of sums by adding `num` to every existing sum in the `dp` set.
   - Merge these new sums back into the `dp` set.
5. After iterating through all numbers, check if the `target` sum exists in the final `dp` set.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. **DP State**: Create a 2D `dp` grid of size `m x n`. `dp[r][c]` will store the number of unique paths to reach cell `(r, c)`.
2. **Initialization**: The first row and first column can only be reached in one way (by only moving right or only moving down). So, initialize `dp[r][0] = 1` for all rows and `dp[0][c] = 1` for all columns.
3. **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops to iterate through the rest of the grid.
4. **Transition**: The number of ways to reach any cell `(r, c)` is the sum of the ways to reach the cell above it and the ways to reach the cell to its left: `dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]`.
5. The final answer is the value in the bottom-right corner, `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

This is a variation of "Unique Paths" where the grid now contains obstacles. If a cell has an obstacle, no path can go through it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The dynamic programming approach is the same, but with an added condition for obstacles.
1. **DP State**: Create a 2D `dp` grid of size `m x n`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize the starting cell `dp[0][0]` to 1 (unless it's an obstacle). The rest of the first row and column are filled based on whether the path is blocked by an obstacle. If `grid[r][0]` is an obstacle, `dp[r][0]` and all subsequent cells in that column become 0.
3. **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops.
4. **Transition**:
   - If the current cell `grid[r][c]` is an obstacle, the number of paths to it is 0: `dp[r][c] = 0`.
   - Otherwise, the transition is the same as before: `dp[r][c] = dp[r-1][c] + dp[r][c-1]`.

  'as-minimum-path-sum': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is another grid-based dynamic programming problem. The grid is filled with costs, and the goal is to find the path from top-left to bottom-right with the minimum total cost.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The logic is very similar to "Unique Paths," but instead of summing the number of paths, we are summing the costs and finding the minimum.
1. **DP State**: We can modify the grid in-place. `grid[r][c]` will store the minimum cost to reach that cell.
2. **Initialization**: The first row is updated by adding the costs from the left. The first column is updated by adding the costs from above.
3. **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops.
4. **Transition**: The minimum cost to reach cell `(r, c)` is its own cost plus the minimum of the costs from the cell above and the cell to the left: `grid[r][c] += Math.min(grid[r-1][c], grid[r][c-1])`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
Breadth-First Search (BFS) is the standard algorithm for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
1. **Setup**: Add the `beginWord` to a queue and a `visited` set. Keep track of the current path length (level).
2. **BFS Loop**: While the queue is not empty:
   - Process all nodes at the current level.
   - For each `word` dequeued:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1. **DP State**: Create a `dp` table of the same size (plus one for padding). `dp[r][c]` will store the side length of the largest square whose **bottom-right corner** is at cell `(r-1, c-1)` in the original matrix.
2. **Initialization**: The first row and column of the DP table correspond to the original matrix.
3. **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops.
4. **Transition**: If `matrix[r-1][c-1]` is a '1', the size of the square ending here is limited by the squares ending at its top, left, and top-left neighbors. The formula is: `dp[r][c] = 1 + Math.min(dp[r-1][c], dp[r][c-1], dp[r-1][c-1])`.
   - If `matrix[r-1][c-1]` is '0', then `dp[r][c] = 0`.

A pre-order traversal (a form of Depth-First Search) is a very common and effective way to do this.
- **Serialize**:
  1. Perform a pre-order traversal.

- **Deserialize**:
  1. Split the string into an array of values.
  2. Use a global pointer or a queue to keep track of the current value.

     - Get the next value from the queue.
     - If it's the null marker, return `null`.
     - Otherwise, create a new node with the value.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a data structure design problem. The challenge is to create a structure that supports insertion, deletion, and retrieving a random element, all in average O(1) time.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The key is to use a combination of two data structures:
1. **An Array**: To store the elements. This provides O(1) time for `getRandom` (by picking a random index). Insertion at the end (`push`) is also O(1).
2. **A Hash Map (`Map`)**: To store each element and its corresponding *index* in the array. This provides O(1) time for looking up if an element exists and finding its position.

- **`insert(val)`**: If `val` is not in the map, append it to the array, and store its new index in the map.
- **`getRandom()`**: Pick a random index from 0 to `array.length - 1` and return the element at that index.
- **`remove(val)`**: This is the clever part. To achieve O(1) deletion from an array, we must avoid shifting elements.
  1. Look up the index of `val` in the map.
  2. Get the last element in the array.
  3. Move the last element to the position of the element being deleted.
  4. Update the map with the new index for the element that was moved.
  5. Pop the last element from the array (which is now a duplicate).

  'as-regular-expression-matching': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a very difficult problem that involves implementing a simplified regular expression engine. The patterns to handle are:
- `.` which matches any single character.
- `*` which matches zero or more of the *preceding* element.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a classic dynamic programming problem, typically solved with a 2D DP table.
1. **DP State**: Create a 2D boolean table `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` is true if the first `i` characters of the string `s` match the first `j` characters of the pattern `p`.
2. **Initialization**: `dp[0][0] = true`. Handle the case where the pattern starts with `*`s, which can match an empty string.
3. **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops. The logic for `dp[i][j]` depends on the character `p[j-1]`:
   - If `p[j-1]` is a normal character or `.`: `dp[i][j]` is true if `s[i-1]` matches and `dp[i-1][j-1]` was true.
   - If `p[j-1]` is `*`: This is the complex case. The `*` can match zero or more characters.
     - **Zero occurrences**: The match depends on `dp[i][j-2]` (we ignore the `*` and the character before it).
     - **One or more occurrences**: The match depends on `dp[i-1][j]` (we match the current character `s[i-1]` and stay at the same pattern position `j` to see if the `*` can match more).
4. The final answer is `dp[s.length][p.length]`.

This is another difficult string matching problem, similar to regex matching but with different wildcard rules:
- `?` matches any single character.
- `*` matches any sequence of characters (including an empty sequence).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A dynamic programming approach is possible, similar to the previous problem. An efficient greedy approach with two pointers is also common.
1. **Pointers**: Use a pointer for the string (`s_ptr`), a pointer for the pattern (`p_ptr`), a pointer to the last star in the pattern (`star_idx`), and a pointer to the position in the string that the star matched (`s_tmp_idx`).
2. **Loop**: Iterate through the string.
   - If the characters match or the pattern has a `?`, advance both pointers.
   - If the pattern has a `*`, store its position (`star_idx`) and the current string position (`s_tmp_idx`), and advance only the pattern pointer.
   - If there is a mismatch, but we have seen a `*` before (`star_idx` is not -1), it means the `*` can match one more character. We backtrack by resetting the pattern pointer to just after the star (`p_ptr = star_idx + 1`) and the string pointer to one position after the star's last match (`s_ptr = ++s_tmp_idx`).
   - If there's a mismatch and no `*` to backtrack to, the match fails.
3. **Final Check**: After the string is exhausted, any remaining characters in the pattern must be `*`s.

This is a classic and difficult problem. Given an array of heights representing a histogram, the goal is to find the area of the largest rectangle that can be inscribed under the bars.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The most efficient solution uses a **monotonic stack**. The stack will store the indices of the histogram bars in increasing order of their height.
1. Initialize `maxArea = 0` and an empty `stack`.
2. Loop through the `heights` array (conceptually appending a bar of height 0 at the end to flush the stack).
3. **`while` Loop**: For each bar `i`, while the stack is not empty and the current bar's height is less than the height of the bar at the index on top of the stack:
   - This means the bar at the top of the stack is the height of a potential rectangle.
   - Pop the index from the stack. Let this be `h`.
   - The width of the rectangle is from the new top of the stack to the current index `i`.
   - Calculate the `area = heights[h] * width` and update `maxArea`.
4. **Push**: After the `while` loop, push the current index `i` onto the stack.

1. Initialize `maxArea = 0`.
2. Create an array `heights` of the same width as the matrix, initialized to zeros.
3. **Loop through Rows**: Iterate through each `row` of the matrix.
4. **Build Histogram**: For each `row`, update the `heights` array. For each column `j`:
   - If `matrix[row][j]` is '1', increment `heights[j]`.
   - If `matrix[row][j]` is '0', reset `heights[j]` to 0.
   - This `heights` array now represents a histogram for the current row and all rows above it.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A naive approach of searching for each word individually would be too slow. A highly efficient solution combines a **Trie** data structure with backtracking (DFS).
1. **Build Trie**: Insert all the words from the dictionary into a Trie. A Trie is a tree-like data structure that is very efficient for prefix searches. Mark the end of each word in the Trie.
2. **Backtracking on the Grid**:
   - Use nested loops to start a DFS from every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
   - The DFS function will take the current cell and the current Trie node as arguments.
3. **DFS Logic**:
   - Check for out-of-bounds or if the current character's path doesn't exist in the Trie from the current Trie node. If so, return.
   - Move to the next Trie node corresponding to the current character.
   - If the new Trie node marks the end of a word, add that word to the results. To avoid duplicates, you might also "un-mark" it in the Trie.

  'as-basic-calculator-iii': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is the most advanced version of the basic calculator problem. It requires handling numbers, `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and nested parentheses.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The standard algorithm for this is a variation of Dijkstra's "Shunting-yard algorithm" or simply using two stacks: one for numbers (`values`) and one for operators (`ops`).
1. Loop through the string.
   - If it's a digit, build the number.
   - If it's `(`: Push it onto the `ops` stack.
   - If it's `)`: Evaluate the expression inside the parentheses by repeatedly popping from `values` and `ops` and applying the operations until you find the matching `(`.
   - If it's an operator: While the `ops` stack is not empty and the operator at the top has higher or equal precedence, evaluate that operation first. Then, push the current operator onto the `ops` stack.
2. After the main loop, evaluate any remaining operations on the stacks.
3. The final result is the single number left on the `values` stack.

A recursive solution is also possible, where a function is called to evaluate the expression inside a pair of parentheses.

  'as-sliding-window-median': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a very advanced sliding window problem. As a window of size `k` slides across an array, you need to find the median of the elements in the window at each step.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The key to an efficient solution is to maintain the window's elements in a sorted fashion so the median can be found quickly. The most efficient data structure for this is using **two heaps**:
1. A **Max-Heap** to store the smaller half of the numbers in the window.
2. A **Min-Heap** to store the larger half of the numbers in the window.

The heaps are kept balanced (or nearly balanced) in size. The median can then be calculated in O(1) time from the top elements of the heaps.
- As the window slides:
  - An element is removed from one of the heaps (O(log k)).
  - A new element is added to one of the heaps (O(log k)).
  - The heaps are re-balanced by moving an element from one to the other if their sizes differ by more than 1 (O(log k)).

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Heaps (Priority Queues)**: The ideal data structure for maintaining an ordered collection and quickly accessing the min/max element.
- **Two-Heap Median**: A standard pattern for finding the median of a stream of numbers.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a graph traversal problem on a 2D grid. The task is to find the length of the longest path where each step moves to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, right) with a value that is exactly one greater.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization is a good approach.
1. **Memoization**: Create a `memo` table of the same size as the grid to store the length of the longest path *starting* at each cell.
2. **Outer Loops**: Iterate through every cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
3. **DFS Function**: For each cell, call a `dfs(r, c)` helper function.
   - If the result for `(r, c)` is already in the `memo` table, return it.
   - Otherwise, initialize `maxLength = 1` (for the cell itself).
   - Check all four neighbors. If a neighbor `(nr, nc)` has a value of `grid[r][c] + 1`, it's a valid next step.
   - Make a recursive call: `1 + dfs(nr, nc)`. Update `maxLength` with the result.
   - Store the final `maxLength` in `memo[r][c]` and return it.
4. Keep track of the overall maximum length found from all starting DFS calls.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to find all characters that are present in *every single string* in an array of strings. The result should include duplicate characters. For example, if 'l' appears twice in every string, the result should contain 'l', 'l'.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution can be built iteratively. We start with the character counts of the first word and then refine these counts with each subsequent word.
1.  **Initial Frequencies**: Create a frequency map (e.g., an array of 26 zeros for the alphabet) for the first word.
2.  **Loop Through Other Words**: Iterate through the rest of the words in the array.
3.  For each word, create a temporary frequency map for its characters.
4.  **Update Master Frequencies**: Now, update the master frequency map. For each character, its new count should be the *minimum* of its current count and its count in the temporary map. This ensures the character is common to all words seen so far.
5.  **Build Result**: After processing all words, the master frequency map holds the counts of the common characters. Build the final result array from this map.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Frequency Counting**: The core data structure used to track character occurrences.
- **Iterative Refinement**: The set of common characters is refined step-by-step by intersecting it with the characters of each subsequent word.

  'as-valid-palindrome-ii': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem asks if a string can become a palindrome by removing at most *one* character.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A two-pointer approach is efficient. We scan the string from both ends.
1.  **Initialize**: Set a `left` pointer at the start and a `right` pointer at the end.
2.  **Loop**: While `left < right`:
    - If `s[left]` and `s[right]` are the same, they form a palindrome, so we can move the pointers inward.
    - If they are *different*, this is our one chance to make a deletion. The remaining string can only be a palindrome if either the substring *without* `s[left]` is a palindrome, OR the substring *without* `s[right]` is a palindrome.
    - We check both possibilities with a helper palindrome-checking function and return `true` if either one works.
3.  If the loop completes without finding any mismatches, the string was already a palindrome, which is also a valid case. Return `true`.

The goal is to perform run-length encoding on a string. For example, 'aabcccccaaa' should be compressed to 'a2b1c5a3'.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An iterative approach with a single pass is effective.
1.  **Initialize**: Create an empty result string.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through the input string with a pointer `i`.
3.  **Count Runs**: For each character `str[i]`, use a nested `while` loop or another pointer `j` to count how many times that character repeats consecutively.
4.  **Append**: Append the character and its count to the result string.
5.  **Advance Pointer**: Move the main pointer `i` past the run of characters you just counted.
6.  Repeat until the end of the string.
7.  **Final Check**: A common variant of this problem asks to return the original string if the compressed version is not shorter.

### üìö Key Concepts

  'as-one-edit-away': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to determine if two strings are "one edit away" from each other. An edit can be an insertion, a deletion, or a replacement of a single character.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution involves analyzing the lengths of the strings first.
1.  **Length Check**: If the difference in lengths is greater than 1, it's impossible to make them the same with one edit, so return `false`.
2.  **Same Length (Replacement Check)**: If the lengths are the same, iterate through both strings simultaneously. Count the number of differing characters. If the difference count is 0 or 1, they are one edit away.
3.  **Different Length (Insert/Delete Check)**: If the lengths differ by 1, use two pointers, one for each string. Iterate through both. When you find a mismatch, advance the pointer of the *longer* string, effectively simulating a "deletion" from the longer string (or an "insertion" into the shorter one). Allow this to happen only once. If you find a second mismatch, return `false`.

  'as-rotate-string': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A "left shift" or "rotation" on a string moves the first character to the end. The task is to check if one string can become another through some number of these rotations.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
There is a very clever and concise trick to solve this problem.
1.  **Length Check**: First, if the two strings do not have the same length, it's impossible, so return `false`.
2.  **Concatenation Trick**: Create a new string by concatenating the original string `s` with itself (`s + s`).
3.  **Check Inclusion**: Check if this new, doubled string contains the `goal` string. If it does, then `s` can be rotated to become `goal`.

Example: `s = "abcde"`, `goal = "cdeab"`.
`s + s` becomes `"abcdeabcde"`.
This new string clearly contains `"cdeab"` as a substring.

The goal is to find the minimum number of parentheses (`(` or `)`) that need to be added to a string to make it a valid parentheses string.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A single pass through the string with a balance counter is very effective.
1.  **Initialize**: Set two counters, `open_needed` and `close_needed`, to 0. `close_needed` can also be thought of as the current balance of open parentheses.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through the string.
    - If you see an opening parenthesis `(`, increment `close_needed`.
    - If you see a closing parenthesis `)`, decrement `close_needed`.
    - **Key Insight**: If `close_needed` ever becomes negative, it means we have an unmatched closing parenthesis. We must add an opening parenthesis to fix it. So, increment `open_needed` and reset `close_needed` back to 0.
3.  **Final Result**: After the loop, `open_needed` has the count of opening parentheses we had to add. `close_needed` has the count of any remaining open parentheses that need to be closed. The total additions needed is `open_needed + close_needed`.

### üìö Key Concepts

The task is to compare two strings after processing backspaces (`#`). For example, "ab#c" becomes "ac".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A simple approach is to build the final strings and then compare them.
1.  **Helper Function**: Create a helper function that takes a string and processes the backspaces.
2.  **Build Final String**: Inside the helper, iterate through the input string. Use a stack (or an array) to build the result.
    - If the character is not a `#`, push it onto the stack.
    - If the character is a `#` and the stack is not empty, pop from the stack.
3.  Join the characters in the stack to get the final string.

A single pass through the array can solve this.
1.  **Initialize**: Keep track of the current positive number we expect to see, `current_num = 1`, and the count of missing numbers found so far, `missing_count = 0`.
2.  **Iterate**: Use a pointer `i` for the array.
3.  **Loop**: While `missing_count < k`:
    - If the number at `arr[i]` is equal to `current_num`, it means this number is present. Advance the array pointer `i`.
    - If it's not equal, it means `current_num` is missing. Increment `missing_count`.
    - In either case, increment `current_num` to check for the next positive integer.
4.  **Result**: When the loop terminates, `current_num - 1` will be the `k`-th missing positive number.

A binary search approach can provide a more efficient O(log n) solution.

1.  **Initialize**: Set `left = 0`, `maxLength = 0`, and `zeroCount = 0`.
2.  **Expand Window**: Loop through the array with a `right` pointer.
    - If `arr[right]` is a 0, increment `zeroCount`.

  'as-duplicate-zeros': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to modify a fixed-length array in-place. For every zero, you must duplicate it, shifting the subsequent elements to the right. Elements shifted off the end are lost.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A naive approach of inserting zeros and shifting would be inefficient (O(n^2)). A better approach is a two-pass solution.
1.  **First Pass (Count Zeros)**: Loop through the array to count the number of zeros that will be duplicated within the final bounds of the array. This helps determine the final length of the content to be considered.
2.  **Second Pass (Write Backwards)**: Loop *backwards* from the end of the conceptual new length.
   - Use a "write pointer" starting at the end of the new conceptual length and a "read pointer" at the end of the original length.
   - Copy elements from the read pointer to the write pointer.
   - If the element at the read pointer is a zero, write it twice to the write positions and decrement the write pointer an extra time.
This backward pass prevents overwriting elements before they have been read and moved.

The most efficient solution uses a `Set` to keep track of the numbers seen so far.
1.  **Initialize**: Create an empty `Set` called `seen`.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through each `num` in the array.
3.  **Check**: For each `num`, check if either its double (`num * 2`) or its half (`num / 2`) already exists in the `seen` set.
    - If either exists, you've found a valid pair, so return `true`.

A recursive backtracking function is used to build the parenthesis strings. The function needs to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses used so far.
1.  **`backtrack(currentString, openCount, closeCount)`**:
    - **Base Case**: If `currentString.length` equals `2 * n`, we have a complete and valid combination. Add it to the results.
    - **Recursive Steps**:
      - **Add an open parenthesis**: If we still have open parentheses left to use (`openCount < n`), we can add one. Make a recursive call with the updated string and `openCount`.

  'as-reverse-words-in-a-string-ii': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a different string reversal problem. You need to iterate through the string in chunks of size \`2k\`. For each chunk, you reverse the first \`k\` characters.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Convert to Array**: Convert the string to an array of characters, as strings are immutable and arrays are easier to modify in place.
2.  **Loop in Chunks**: Use a \`for\` loop that increments its counter by \`2k\` in each step.
3.  **Define Subarray**: In each iteration, define the start and end indices of the part to be reversed. The start is \`i\`, and the end is \`Math.min(i + k - 1, arr.length - 1)\` to handle cases where the final chunk is smaller than \`k\`.
4.  **Reverse Subarray**: Use a two-pointer approach (or a helper function) to reverse the characters within these start and end bounds.
5.  **Join**: After the loop, join the character array back into a string.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Chunking**: Processing an array or string in fixed-size blocks.
- **In-place Subarray Reversal**: An efficient way to reverse a portion of an array.

  'as-valid-word-abbreviation': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to check if a given abbreviation is valid for a word. The abbreviation can contain letters and numbers. A number represents a count of skipped characters. For example, "i12iz4n" is a valid abbreviation for "internationalization".

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A two-pointer approach is effective for scanning both the word and the abbreviation simultaneously.
1.  **Initialize**: Set pointers \`i\` (for word) and \`j\` (for abbreviation) to 0.
2.  **Loop**: While both pointers are within their respective string bounds:
    - If the character in the abbreviation is a letter, check if it matches the character in the word. If not, return \`false\`. Then, advance both pointers.
    - If the character is a digit (and not '0' at the start of a number), parse the entire number from the abbreviation. Advance the word pointer `i` by this number.
3.  **Final Check**: The abbreviation is valid only if both pointers have reached the end of their respective strings.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Two-Pointer Technique**: Used to scan and compare two related sequences.
- **String Parsing**: The logic requires parsing numbers out of the abbreviation string.

  'as-find-and-replace-pattern': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This problem is another variation of "Isomorphic Strings". You need to find which words from a list follow the same character pattern as a given pattern string. For pattern "abb", the word "mee" matches, but "abc" does not.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution involves creating a "canonical representation" for both the pattern and each word and then comparing them.
1.  **Canonical Function**: Create a helper function that takes a string and converts it to its canonical pattern. For "abb", it could be "0.1.1". For "mee", it's also "0.1.1". For "abc", it's "0.1.2".
    - This function uses a map to store the first seen index of each character. It builds the canonical string by appending these indices.
2.  **Filter Words**:
    - Calculate the canonical pattern for the input `pattern`.
    - Use the `.filter()` array method on the `words` list.
    - The filter condition is `getCanonical(word) === canonicalPattern`.

  'as-count-binary-substrings': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to count valid binary substrings. A valid substring has an equal number of 0s and 1s, and all the 0s and 1s are grouped consecutively (e.g., "0011", "10").

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
An efficient solution involves counting the lengths of consecutive groups of identical characters.
1.  **Group Counts**: First, iterate through the string and create an array of the lengths of consecutive groups. For "00110011", this would be `[2, 2, 2, 2]`. For "10101", it would be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`.
2.  **Count Substrings**: Iterate through this new `groups` array from the first element to the second-to-last.
3.  For each pair of adjacent group lengths `groups[i]` and `groups[i+1]`, the number of valid substrings they can form is `Math.min(groups[i], groups[i+1])`.
4.  Add this minimum to a running total.
5.  Return the total.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The goal is to rearrange a string so that no two adjacent characters are the same. If it's impossible, return an empty string.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a greedy problem that can be solved efficiently with a frequency map and a max-heap, but a simpler greedy approach also works.
1.  **Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map of all characters.
2.  **Check Impossibility**: Find the most frequent character. If its count is more than half the string length rounded up, it's impossible to rearrange. Return "".
3.  **Greedy Placement**:
    - Sort the characters by frequency in descending order.
    - Create a result array.
    - Place the most frequent characters at the even indices first (0, 2, 4, ...).
    - Then, place the remaining characters at the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...).
4.  This two-pass placement strategy ensures that the most frequent characters are separated as much as possible, guaranteeing a valid arrangement if one exists.
5.  Join the result array into a string.

  'as-custom-sort-string': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
You are given a `order` string which defines a custom alphabetical order, and a second string `s`. You need to sort `s` according to the custom order defined by `order`. Characters not in `order` should be appended at the end in their original alphabetical order.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A frequency map is a great way to handle this.
1.  **Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map of the characters in the string `s`.
2.  **Build Sorted String**:
    - Initialize an empty `result` string.
    - Iterate through the `order` string. For each character, if it exists in the frequency map, append it to the `result` that many times and then remove it from the map.
3.  **Append Remainder**: After the first loop, the map only contains characters from `s` that were not in `order`. Iterate through the remaining entries in the map (in alphabetical order) and append them to the `result` string.

  'as-partition-labels': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to partition a string into the maximum number of parts, with the constraint that each letter can only appear in one part.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A greedy approach with two passes can solve this efficiently.
1.  **First Pass (Last Occurrences)**: Create a map or array to store the last seen index of every character in the string.
2.  **Second Pass (Partitioning)**:
    - Initialize `start = 0` (start of the current partition) and `end = 0` (farthest reach of the current partition).
    - Iterate through the string with a pointer `i`.
    - For each character `s[i]`, update the `end` of the current partition to be the maximum of its current value and the last occurrence index of `s[i]` (from our map).
    - **Key Insight**: If the current index `i` has reached the `end` of the current partition, it means all characters within this partition have their last occurrences also within this partition. We have found a complete partition.
    - Record the size of this partition (`end - start + 1`) and update `start` to `i + 1` for the next partition.

  'as-repeated-string-match': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to find the minimum number of times a string `a` must be repeated so that another string `b` becomes a substring of the repeated string.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Initialize**: Create a temporary string `s` with the initial value of `a`, and a `count` of 1.
2.  **Loop**: Use a `while` loop to keep appending `a` to `s` as long as the length of `s` is less than the length of `b`. Increment `count` in each step.
3.  **Check**: After the loop, `s` is now at least as long as `b`. Check if `s` includes `b`.
    - If it does, `count` is the answer.
    - If it doesn't, there's one more possibility: `b` might span across the seam of two `a`'s. Append `a` one more time (`s + a`) and check again. If it's found now, the answer is `count + 1`.
4.  If it's still not found, it's impossible. Return -1.

### üìö Key Concepts

  'as-longest-uncommon-subsequence-i': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
A "subsequence" is a sequence that can be derived from another by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining ones. An "uncommon subsequence" is a subsequence of one string that is *not* a subsequence of the other. The task is to find the length of the longest such subsequence.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This problem has a surprisingly simple trick.
1.  **Check for Equality**: If the two strings `a` and `b` are exactly the same, then any subsequence of `a` is also a subsequence of `b`. There is no uncommon subsequence. Return -1.
2.  **Return Max Length**: If the strings are different, then the longer of the two strings is itself a subsequence of itself, but it cannot be a subsequence of the shorter string. Therefore, the longest uncommon subsequence is simply the longer of the two strings. Return `Math.max(a.length, b.length)`.

### üí° Problem Breakdown
The task is to check if a list of words is sorted lexicographically according to a given custom alphabet order.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
1.  **Create Order Map**: First, create a hash map that maps each character in the `order` string to its position (0, 1, 2, ...). This allows for O(1) lookups of a character's rank.
2.  **Loop Through Pairs**: Iterate through the `words` array, comparing each adjacent pair of words (`words[i]` and `words[i+1]`).
3.  **Compare Words**: For each pair, use a second loop to compare them character by character.
    - Find the first character where the two words differ.
    - Look up the rank of these differing characters in your order map.
    - If the rank of the character in the first word is greater than the rank in the second word, the list is not sorted. Return `false`.
    - If the rank in the first word is smaller, this pair is correctly ordered. Break the inner loop and check the next pair of words.
4.  **Prefix Check**: If the inner loop finishes without finding a difference, it means one word is a prefix of the other (e.g., "apple" and "app"). The list is only sorted if the shorter word comes first. Check for this case.
5.  If you get through all pairs without returning `false`, the list is sorted.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
A single pass with a balance counter is effective.
1.  **Initialize**: `result` string and a `balance` counter.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through the input string.
3.  **Logic**:
    - If the character is `(` and the `balance` is currently greater than 0, it means this is *not* an outermost opening parenthesis, so append it to the result.
    - If the character is `)` and the `balance` is greater than 1, it means this is *not* an outermost closing parenthesis, so append it to the result.

The task is to reverse a string, but only the English letters should be reversed. All other characters (like numbers, symbols, hyphens) must stay in their original positions.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The two-pointer technique is a perfect fit for this in-place reversal.
1.  **Initialize**: Convert the string to an array of characters. Set a `left` pointer at the start and a `right` pointer at the end.
2.  **Loop**: While `left < right`:
    - Use a nested `while` loop to move the `left` pointer forward until it points to a letter.
    - Use another nested `while` loop to move the `right` pointer backward until it points to a letter.
    - **Swap**: Once both pointers are on letters, swap the characters at `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`.
    - **Advance**: Move both pointers inward (`left++`, `right--`).
3.  **Join**: Join the character array back into a string.

1.  Dots (`.`) in the "local name" part (before the `@`) are ignored.
2.  Anything after a plus sign (`+`) in the local name is ignored.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is to "normalize" each email address according to the rules and then count the number of unique normalized addresses using a `Set`.
1.  **Initialize**: Create an empty `Set` called `uniqueEmails`.
2.  **Loop**: Iterate through each `email` in the input list.
3.  **Normalize**: For each `email`:

A 2D DP table is used to solve this.
1.  **DP State**: Create a table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the longest common substring that *ends* at `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]`.
2.  **Initialization**: Fill the table with zeros. Keep a separate `maxLength` variable.
3.  **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops to iterate through the strings.
4.  **Transition**:
    - If `str1[i-1] === str2[j-1]`: The common substring is extended by one. Set `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`. Update `maxLength` if this new length is greater.

  'as-kmp-string-search': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm is a highly efficient string searching algorithm that achieves O(n+m) time complexity. It avoids redundant comparisons by preprocessing the "needle" (pattern) to understand its internal structure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The algorithm has two parts:
1.  **Preprocessing (LPS Array)**:
    - Create a "Longest Proper Prefix which is also a Suffix" (LPS) array for the pattern.
    - `lps[i]` stores the length of the longest proper prefix of `pattern[0...i]` which is also a suffix of `pattern[0...i]`.
    - This array tells us how many characters to "skip" forward on a mismatch.
2.  **Searching**:
    - Use two pointers, `i` for the text and `j` for the pattern.
    - If `text[i] === pattern[j]`, increment both.
    - If `j` reaches the end of the pattern, a match is found.
    - If a mismatch occurs after some characters have matched (`j > 0`), instead of resetting `j` to 0, we consult the LPS array: `j = lps[j-1]`. This moves the pattern pointer to the end of the prefix that we know already matches, avoiding re-checking those characters.

The Rabin-Karp algorithm is another string-searching algorithm. Its key idea is to use **hashing** to quickly compare substrings. Instead of comparing characters one by one, it compares the hash value of the pattern with the hash value of substrings in the text.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough

Manacher's algorithm is a highly advanced and clever algorithm that finds the longest palindromic substring in a string in O(n) linear time, which is an improvement over the O(n^2) "Expand from Center" approach.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The algorithm is complex, but the core ideas are:
1.  **Transform String**: The input string is transformed to handle even-length palindromes easily. This is done by inserting a special character (like '#') between every character (e.g., "aba" -> "#a#b#a#"). Now, every palindrome has a unique center.
2.  **Palindrome Radii Array**: An array `P` is maintained, where `P[i]` stores the radius of the palindrome centered at `i` in the transformed string.
3.  **Leverage Symmetry**: The key insight is to reuse previous calculations. It keeps track of the `center` and `right` boundary of the palindrome found so far that extends farthest to the right. For a new position `i`, it can use the symmetry of palindromes to intelligently initialize the palindrome radius `P[i]` based on its mirror image, avoiding many redundant character comparisons.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The Z-array can be constructed in O(n) time by maintaining a "Z-box" `[L, R]`, which is the interval that corresponds to the prefix-substring with the rightmost endpoint found so far.
- When calculating `Z[i]`, if `i` is outside the current Z-box, a naive character-by-character comparison is done to find the new Z-box.
- If `i` is *inside* the Z-box, we can use the previously computed Z-values of its mirror position to initialize `Z[i]`, potentially avoiding many comparisons.

Once the Z-array is built for the string `pattern + '#' + text`, any position where the Z-value equals the length of the pattern indicates a match.

1.  **Build Trie**: Insert all the keywords from the dictionary into a Trie.

3.  **Search**: Process the input text character by character through the state machine.
    - If the character matches a child of the current node, transition to that child.
    - If there's no match, follow the failure links until a match is found or you reach the root.
    - At each node you visit, check if it marks the end of a keyword. If so, you've found a match.

  'as-longest-palindromic-subsequence': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
This is a dynamic programming problem. A "subsequence" does not have to be contiguous. The task is to find the longest subsequence of a string that is also a palindrome. For "bbbab", the longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb" (length 4).

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
The solution is a clever application of the "Longest Common Subsequence" (LCS) algorithm. The longest palindromic subsequence of a string `s` is the same as the longest common subsequence between `s` and its reverse, `reverse(s)`.
1.  **Reverse**: Create a reversed version of the input string `s`.
2.  **LCS**: Apply the standard LCS algorithm (using a 2D DP table) to the original string and the reversed string.
3.  The result of the LCS algorithm is the answer.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Problem Reduction**: Transforming the problem into another, well-known problem (LCS).
- **Dynamic Programming**: The underlying algorithm used to solve LCS.

  'as-edit-distance': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Edit distance (specifically, Levenshtein distance) is a measure of the difference between two strings. It's the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one string into the other.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a classic dynamic programming problem.
1.  **DP State**: Create a 2D DP table, `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` is the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`.
2.  **Initialization**: Initialize the first row and column. The distance from an empty string to a string of length `j` is `j` insertions.
3.  **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops.
4.  **Transition**:
    - If `word1[i-1] === word2[j-1]`, no operation is needed for these characters. The cost is the same as the cost for the strings without them: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    - If they are different, we must perform one operation. We take the minimum cost of the three possibilities:
      - Deletion: `dp[i-1][j]`
      - Insertion: `dp[i][j-1]`
      - Substitution: `dp[i-1][j-1]`
      And we add 1 for the cost of the operation.
5.  The final answer is `dp[word1.length][word2.length]`.

  'as-longest-common-subsequence': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem is to find the longest subsequence common to two sequences (e.g., two strings). A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This is a classic dynamic programming problem solved with a 2D DP table.
1.  **DP State**: `dp[i][j]` will store the length of the LCS for `text1`'s prefix of length `i` and `text2`'s prefix of length `j`.
2.  **Fill DP Table**: Use nested loops.
3.  **Transition**:
    - If `text1[i-1] === text2[j-1]`, the last characters match. They are part of the LCS. So, `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    - If they do not match, the LCS is the best we can do by either ignoring the last character of `text1` or ignoring the last character of `text2`. So, `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
4.  The final answer is the value in the bottom-right corner of the table.

  'as-minimum-ascii-delete-sum': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Given two strings, the goal is to make them equal by deleting characters from either string. The cost of deleting a character is its ASCII value. The task is to find the minimum total cost of deletions to make the strings equal.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This problem can be reframed. The characters that *remain* in both strings must form a common subsequence. To minimize the sum of deleted characters, we want to maximize the sum of the common subsequence that we *keep*.
1.  **Find LCS with Max ASCII Sum**: This is a variation of the Longest Common Subsequence problem. The DP state `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum ASCII sum of a common subsequence between prefixes of the two strings.
    - If characters match, `dp[i][j] = s1.charCodeAt(i-1) + dp[i-1][j-1]`.
    - If they don't match, `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
2.  **Calculate Total Sum**: Calculate the sum of ASCII values of all characters in both original strings.
3.  **Final Answer**: The minimum delete sum is `(totalSum) - 2 * (maxAsciiSumOfLCS)`. We multiply by 2 because each character in the common subsequence was counted once in each string's total sum.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Programming**: An extension of the standard LCS problem.
- **Problem Reframing**: The insight is to switch from minimizing deletions to maximizing what is kept.

  'as-integer-break': `
### üí° Problem Breakdown
Given an integer `n`, the task is to break it into a sum of at least two positive integers, and then maximize the product of those integers.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Solution Walkthrough
This problem can be solved with dynamic programming, but it also has a mathematical insight that leads to a greedy O(n) solution.
- The best numbers to break `n` into are 2s and 3s. Any number greater than 4 can be broken down into smaller parts that give a larger product (e.g., 6 is better as 3+3 (product 9) than 2+4 (product 8)). A 4 is equivalent to 2+2 (product 4).
- It's always better to use 3s than 2s where possible (e.g., for 6, 3+3 gives product 9, while 2+2+2 gives product 8).
- **Greedy Strategy**:
  1. Handle small base cases for n=2 and n=3.
  2. While `n > 4`, repeatedly subtract 3 and multiply the result by 3.
  3. The remaining `n` will be 2, 3, or 4. Multiply the result by this remaining `n`.

### üìö Key Concepts
- **Dynamic Programming / Mathematical Insight**: A problem that can be solved with a standard DP approach but also has a more efficient greedy solution based on mathematical properties.
